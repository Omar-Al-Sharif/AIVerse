Adding that \"almost a year of being isolated from classmates, friends and teachers is taking a terrifying toll on these kids.\"Herrera expanded his lawsuit Tuesday, to include allegations of violating students' rights to attend public schools under the state's Constitution, discriminating against students on the basis of wealth - as only the city's private schools have reopened - and violating the state's law to \"offer in-person instruction to the greatest extent possible.\"The suit states that over 110 private schools have reopened with more than 15,800 students having returned to the classroom, but so far, fewer than five cases of in-school virus transmission have been reported.Herrera also pointed to the neighboring county of Marin, where 90% of all public and private schools have reopened their doors to in-person teaching, with just nine cases of in-school transmission having been confirmed.\"Mental health experts report that kids of all ages are experiencing severe mental health problems: depression, anxiety, self-harming behavior, suicidal thoughts. And yet, public schools in San Francisco remain shut,\" Herrera said. \"It's unconscionable, it's unlawful and it must end.\"The City Attorney's office also pointed to data released by UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital of Oakland, which has reported a 68 percent increase in the number of suicidal children being admitted to the emergency room. There has also been a 75 percent increase in the number of children seeking mental health assistance.A spokesperson for the SFUSD told Fox News Thursday that they \"wholeheartedly agree that students are better served with in-person learning.\" But said that reopening schools is \"very complex and requires partnership.\"\"We are committed to continuing to work together with the City and labor unions to offer in-person learning options to students as soon as possible,\" SFUSD spokesperson, Laura Dudnick said. We are eager for the City to make vaccines available to our staff.\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that it is not necessary for all teachers to be vaccinated before being able to safely return to the classrooms. But the said earlier this week that teachers will re-enter the classroom once they have all been vaccinated - a \"plan\" that San Francisco Mayor London Breed and the City Attorney's office have taken issue with.\"Almost a year into this pandemic, it is simply unacceptable that parents and guardians haven't been provided a date for when their kids will return to in-person learning,\" Breed said in a Thursday. \"Families are paralyzed, unable to plan for their future.\"\"And they feel frustrated, especially as the School Board has made national headlines over efforts to rename many of the very same schools that they have no plan to actually reopen,\" she added, alluding to the 44 schools the board decided were named after figures they deemed offensive, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.The renaming process is estimated to cost between $400,000 to $1 million to change school uniform, signs and equipment carrying the name.Fox News could not immediately the San Francisco Board of Education.A hearing on the motion is set for March 22.Caitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news.", "tags": ["california", "politics", "sanfrancisco", "education", "coronavirus"], "published_time": "2021-02-11 20:26:08", "modified_time": "2021-02-11 22:14:09"}

Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden for president on Monday, less than a week after campaign for the Democratic Party nomination.The Vermont senator made the announcement during a livestreamed virtual event with Biden, the former vice president who is now his party's presumptive presidential nominee.\"We are in a terrible moment, an unprecedented moment and I know we share the understand that we have to go forward, right now and out of this, in an unprecedented way to address the terrible pain that so many of our fellow Americans are feeling,\" Sanders said.\"So today I am asking all Americans, I'm asking every Democrat and I'm asking every independent, I'm asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse, to make certain that we defeat somebody who I believe, and I'm speaking just for myself now, is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country,\" he said.The announcement settles speculation on whether and when Sanders would formally back his former primary rival. He notably did not endorse when he suspended his campaign last week, stoking speculation about a lingering ideological divide -- one which still may persist between Sanders supporters and the Biden camp.In a curious moment during last week's announcement, Sanders even highlighted that he would keep his name on the upcoming primary ballots and stressed the importance of continuing to win delegates for his own campaign so he'd be able to exert \"influence\" on the party platform.But Biden was visibly reaching out to Sanders and his base, adjusting his own campaign platform in a bid to make it more appealing to progressive voters, many of whom had backed Sanders.Biden said in a statement last week that Sanders and his supporters \"changed the dialogue.\"In Monday's announcement, Sanders pointed to the coronavirus crisis facing the nation and emphasized to Biden that \"we don't have a choice. We have to come together.\"The independent who was making his second straight White House run announced that the two campaigns were teaming up for six working groups to tackle the key issues of the economy, education, climate change, criminal justice reform, immigration reform, and health care.\"I have been very pleased that your staff and my staff have been working together over the last several weeks to coming up with a number of task forces that will look at some of the most important issues facing this country,\" Sanders said.The senator acknowledged that \"it's no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences and we're not going to paper them over. That's real. But I hope these task forces will come together utilizing the best minds - people in your campaign and in my campaign - to work out real solutions to these very, very, important problems. I look forward to working with you and bringing some great people into those task forces.\"A gracious Biden thanked his rival, saying, \"Bernie, I want to thank you for that. It's a big deal. Your endorsement means a great deal to me. I think people are surprised that we are apart on some issues but we're awfully close on a bunch of others.\"And he joked that \"you just made me\" the nominee.The former vice president spotlighted that \"I'm going to need you - not just to win the campaign - but to govern.\"The day after Sanders ended his White House bid, Biden showcased new proposals to lower the to age 60 and forgive student loan debt for low-income and middle-class families.In reaching out to the left, the former vice president credited and his legions of progressive and younger supporters for his embrace of the proposals.The move was a significant step toward Sanders' push for a government-run \"Medicare-for-all\" single-payer health care system, which was the senator's signature domestic proposal in his 2020 presidential campaign. But it doesn't go as far as Sanders's plan, which calls for phasing in all Americans over a four-year period and phasing out private health insurance plans.Biden, Sanders, and the Democratic Party as a whole are all trying to avoid a repeat of the bitterness of the 2016 campaign, when many Sanders supporters refused to support eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in her general election showdown with Donald Trump. The deep divisions in the party were a contributing factor in Trump's upset victory over Clinton in the presidential election.For Biden - who needs the support of progressives in order to unify the party as he challenges - a delicate dance is ahead. The former vice president clearly needs to embrace more of Sanders' progressive agenda if he wants to seal the deal with that part of the base.But going too far left may leave Biden vulnerable to attacks from Trump that he's pushing a socialist agenda. Trump and his allies have hammered the message since the beginning of the cycle that the Democratic Party has drifted far to the left of most Americans. They are eager to paint Biden with that brush.Minutes after Sanders endorsed Biden, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale argued that \"this is further proof that even though Bernie Sanders won't be on the ballot in November, his issues will be.\"Ahead of the Sanders endorsement, the Biden campaign spotlighted their efforts to reach out to progressive leaders and organizations in the past several weeks.\"We are continuously considering and evaluating additional policies that would build upon Vice President Biden's progressive agenda,\" Biden spokesman Matt Hill told Fox News. \"The most important piece of engaging progressive leaders and groups is to ensure we're expanding and broadening our coalition to beat Donald Trump in November, and we are working with these leaders and groups to align on our efforts to do that. Defeating Trump is the universal commitment that we all share,\" he emphasized.A former Sanders aide told Fox News after the announcement that the senator \"always said he was going to fully support the nominee and do everything he could to help them get Trump out of office, so this is just making good on his word which Bernie Sanders always does.\"Sen.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the 2020 House election.outlined key areas where she'd like to see move further left -- as she indicated her willingness to actively campaign for the former vice president will be contingent, in part, on whether he adopts more \"ambitious\" policies.Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she's been in touch with Biden's team about her potential role in the campaign and urged him to shift in a more progressive direction on health care, immigration, climate change and even Puerto Rico.\"I would love to see the vice president clarify and deepen his policy stances on certain issues,\" Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday morning in an interview with Politico's Playbook. \"But aside from that, you know, I think it's incredibly important that we support the Democratic nominee in November.\"She also urged Biden to chose a vice presidential nominee who will \"push\" him more to the progressive left.\"I think it would be encouraging if Biden also picked someone who's a little bit more progressive that ... he knows may push him,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.While Biden has already secured the top Democrats' endorsements, including Bernie Sanders, former President Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Ocasio-Cortez's wholehearted endorsement is still lacking. She said in a recent interview that Biden's campaign had not yet reached out, though that has apparently changed.Ocasio-Cortez said she'll support the Democratic nominee and stand behind her 14th District constituents who back Biden, but her degree of involvement with the campaign is unclear. The former Sanders surrogate has a huge platform to speak directly to two constituencies that Biden could use some help with in order to win in November -- young people and Latinos.Her involvement in the campaign will be contingent on what Biden wants and on their ongoing policy conversations, she said.\"There are very real tangible areas where Democrats even fall short perhaps during the Obama administration that I think I would like us to have a plan to improve, particularly when it comes to Puerto Rico, when it comes to immigration, when it comes to health care for Americans,\" Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday. \"I don't think lowering (the Medicare age) to 60 is going to be enough for us.\"She said Biden needs to do more on climate change.\"We're going to have to pursue a much more ambitious healthcare policy and climate change [plan]. I don't think that the vice president has a climate change policy that is sufficient right now and I'd like to see us really work on that.\"Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged the disappointment among many passionate Sanders supporters, but she also urged them to face the reality that Biden is going to be the nominee.\"At the end of the day, one of these two people are going to be president. It's either going to be Donald Trump or Joe Biden, that will be elected president in November, and we have to live in the reality of ... those choices and I know that there may be a lot of folks that are uncomfortable with that,\" she said.She spoke of her constituents in the Bronx and Queens and said the election outcome \"can very much mean the difference between life and death or, you know, being separated from their children or not.\"\"For me personally, [it's] very important to be in solidarity ... with the families that I represent in supporting Joe Biden.\"", "tags": ["alexandria-ocasio-cortez", "politics", "joe-biden", "2020-presidential-election", "elections"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 10:43:59", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 14:14:10"}

Fox News has with the District's police department that she filed the criminal complaint, which does not reference Biden by name.Reade, who previously openly advocated for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, has said that she will not vote for Joe Biden in November.\"I will not ever vote in a national election again,\" Reade said in a statement to Fox News. \"Despite the fact I come from a family of Democrats. I worked for Leon Panetta, [California] State Sen. Jack O'Connell and Joe Biden. I worked hard for the Democratic Party as a young woman. It is obvious by the tremendous smears about me leveled by Biden campaign and supporters after I came forward about Biden and the complete lack of support from any Democrat that they care more about protecting Joe Biden than addressing the serious allegations by me and the other seven women who complained about his misconduct.\"She continued: \"Kamala Harris is my representative and I reached out to her for help. No response. Joe Biden sexually assaulted and harassed me. All the rest of political discussion is noise and an effort to distract from the serious lack of justice I experienced at his hands. Coming forward has been difficult and resulted in 1993 with the loss of my job and career. Coming forward last spring 2019 about the sexual harassment resulted with his supporters smearing me online. And now, again. So, no, I will not vote for Joe Biden.\"Despite the Biden denials, the story has moved forward -- if slowly -- in recent weeks.The ran a story Sunday which said it could not \"corroborate any details of Ms. Reade's allegation\" and found no pattern of such behavior by Biden, but also mentioned the paper had spoken to two of Reade's friends who say she had previously told them about the alleged assault.The also ran a long story on the Reade allegations Sunday.Also Sunday, former Sanders campaign National Press Secretary Briahna Joy Gray referred to Reade's story as \"[c]redible sexual assault allegations\" as she listed off a number of issues she believed Sanders \"generously\" did not raise against Biden during the Democratic primary. She is one of a few scattered liberal voices who are advocating that the Reade allegation be taken seriously, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and liberal activist Rose McGowan.\"As a survivor, the way you launched into this woman's assault is truly vile,\" McGowan Sunday about the Washington Post story on the Reade allegations. \"Your motto is 'Democracy Dies in Darkness' well I guess it's dead because you are dark. Evil lives and it loves the DNC.\"\"I think it's legitimate to talk about these things,\" Ocasio-Cortez while speaking with the women's organization The Wing on Tuesday night, according to CBS News. \"And if we want, if we, again, want to have integrity, you can't say, you know -- both believe women, support all of this, until it inconveniences you, until it inconveniences us.\"Biden has previously indicated that he thinks women who bring forward sexual assault claims should be presumed to be telling the truth.\"For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it's been made worse or better over time,\" Biden told the as allegations of sexual assault swirled around the nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018. \"But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron.\"Biden, however, has not appeared to suffer any political consequences from the Reade allegations so far, securing endorsements from Sanders and former President Obama in recent days even as the accusations swirled.The former vice president, who has said he will choose a woman to be his VP, has also not gotten any public pushback from his potential vice presidential nominees. It's unclear if that will change as the Democratic National Convention moves closer and the presidential election eventually steals back some media headlines after it has been thoroughly upstaged by the coronavirus pandemic.President Trump, who has been the subject of his own sexual assault and harassment allegations in the past, has also not commented on the Reade accusations against Biden.In addition to Harris, Warren, Demings and Yates, Fox News reached out to 12 other Democrats who have been speculated about as possible running mates for Biden, asking them for comment on the sexual assault allegations against the presumptive nominee.Fox News reached out to Klobuchar; Whitmer; Baldwin; Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H.; New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham; Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev.; Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.; Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.; Sen.

{"url": ["https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/coronavirus-lift-public-health-restrictions-scenarios-robert-siegel"], "title": "Dr. Robert Siegel: Coronavirus reopening -- If health restrictions rolled back too soon this could happen", "content": "Presumed deaths have been added to the pandemic count in New York City; David Lee Miller reports from Manhattan.A number of government officials, pundits and data modelers believe is behind us. They may be profoundly mistaken.Consider these .If all public health measures were immediately lifted, the could reignite with full fury. At this point, there is no vaccine. There are no effective drugs. Testing is still woefully inadequate. And the vast majority of people are still completely susceptible to infection.Alternatively, if public health measures were slowly lifted, it could lead to a slow-motion pandemic in which the health system would no longer be in peril of being overwhelmed.If the only deaths that are prevented are the excess deaths from an overwhelmed health care system, the result would still be tragic.Unfortunately, in this second scenario, nearly everyone at risk who was at increased risk before would still be at risk: older individuals, those with underlying health conditions, those living in communal situations, minorities, the impoverished, the unhoused, and those attending large events.Individuals at risk need to be protected both as a moral imperative and as a way of stopping the further spread of the virus and the ongoing impact that will have on everyone.In the absence of drugs, vaccines or pervasive testing, only behavioral measures stand between the relative calm of post-peak rates of infection and disaster.The extent to which disease and death are averted will be a function of how well we maintain \"viral distancing,\" how much we have access to and use masks and gloves and sanitizer, how long we avoid mass gatherings, how well we isolate symptomatic individuals and those with exposure risks, and the extent to which there is testing and contact tracing.We are all being tantalized by the promise that drugs, vaccines and return to the-way-things-were are all just around the corner. But we cannot be certain of any of those things. Yes, the economy can be reopened; but only with pervasive public health measures in place. Access to gloves, masks and sanitizer should be considered a human right and these supplies should be freely available, as Singapore has done.Proper equipment and scrupulous attention to public health measures would allow food production to be carried out safely and supply chains to be maintained. As the incidence of infection begins to fall, people in the service sector of the economy can re-engage.With public health measures and vigilance, testing and contact tracing, recreation areas can be judiciously re-opened.Until there is a vaccine and/or effective treatments, however, large social gatherings of the pre-pandemic type are formulas for viral spread and potentially death. Events of this type include conferences, performances and concerts, and sports events.Remarkably, we still do not know the infection fatality rate. Ongoing serological surveys may soon help to clarify that number. It might be as low as one person in a thousand or it may be a lot higher. Unfortunately, with a less optimistic infection mortality rate, these numbers could be a lot higher.But even the most hopeful predictions could still mean that people who attend large events or their contacts may contract this virus and die painfully and alone. For example, consider the risk of attending a New York Knicks home game with 19,000 potentially infectious fellow fans. Or a Dallas Cowboys home game with 90,000 others -- cheering, yelling, coughing. Will every event come with a risk disclaimer like those on cigarette packs?If everyone attending these events wore masks and gloves and scrupulously washed their hands, the death rates would be lower. They would be even lower if touching were limited. Or if we left one empty seat between each individual. Or if we all watched from home.So the questions are:Even if it were available, testing would not help much for large attendance events because it is expensive, inconvenient and the results are delayed. Moreover, a single negative test does not guarantee that a person is safe.In the case of the PCR test, the result may be negative simply because the sample was inadequate. The antibody test may be negative early in infection before the immune system has had time to react. Therefore individuals with negative antibody tests may be asymptomatic, but highly contagious.Children and young people will have a particularly hard time maintaining public health measures. So, unfortunately, schools may remain a potential source for spreading infection, which students can bring home to their families.Until the incidence in a region is brought to zero, we will be in the midst of an \"active infector\" in the classroom situation. And it is not a drill.Creative solutions are needed to help confront the ongoing burdens associated with continuing public health measures.Even now, many new jobs and new types of jobs are being created, not in spite of, but because of the pandemic. There is a need to scale up jobs in the manufacturing sector such as producing diagnostic tests, medical equipment and protective gear; and jobs in the service sector such as delivery services, health care provision and in monitoring public health vigilance.New types of jobs are being created in the education sector, the communication sector, in data management and in the creation of tools for working remotely. There is also a need to vastly increase scientific and medical research.This new economy can flourish in unimaginable ways.We are all being tantalized by the promise that drugs, vaccines and return to the-way-things-were are all just around the corner.

Andrew Cuomo spars with the president over reopening the economy. should be applauded for his decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) while his administration reviews the group's response to the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. taxpayers write a $400 million blank check to the WHO, an organization that is broken and long overdue for fundamental reform.In fact, the WHO has proven in its handling of the pandemic that it puts politics over public health. Rather than independently investigating or determining the nature and spread of the coronavirus, the WHO instead simply parroted the official pronouncements of the Chinese government and lavished praise on Beijing's response.It's long past time for the United States to hold the accountable for its mismanagement and lack of transparency.As the Trump administration pauses funding to the WHO and examines how the organization has responded to the current crisis, it should demand answers to the following questions:The likely answer to this question is tied to the WHO's consistent animosity toward Taiwan - borne out of its desire to placate the Chinese government. Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province and has repeatedly sought to exclude it from participation in international organizations like the WHO. This view has been emphasized by the WHO's current leadership, particularly its director-general, Tedros Adahnom Ghebreyesus.Tedros went so far recently as to spew unsupported accusations at Taiwan for mounting what he called \"racist\" attacks at him for his handling of the pandemic. Another senior leader of the WHO, Bruce Aylward, painfully avoided questions about Taiwan's handling of the coronavirus and instead complimented China for how it has dealt with it. All appearances suggest that the WHO simply ignored Taiwan to make peace with China, to the detriment of global public health.On Jan. 14, the WHO reaffirmed China's now-debunked claim that the coronavirus could not be transmitted between human beings. This was after evidence had emerged that such transmission had likely already taken place in Wuhan. Two weeks later, Tedros traveled to Beijing and praised Xi Jinping's government for its \"transparency\" in sharing information about the coronavirus. This was after the government had silenced or punished several doctors who spoke out about the virus and restricted Chinese institutions from publishing information about it.During the critical weeks and months when the virus began its spread in China and then around the world, the WHO seemed more interested in playing politics, rather than taking the actions that could have saved lives around the world. Then, on Jan. 31, the WHO argued against travel restrictions to China, arguing they \"can cause more harm than good,\" even though public health officials in the U.S. have largely concluded that President Trump's travel ban helped to slow the spread of the virus here. And why, on Feb. 3, did Tedros say that the spread of the virus outside of China was \"minimal and slow,\" even though hundreds were infected around the world, including a handful in the United States?It did not declare a public health emergency until almost two months after the reported onset of first symptoms in a Wuhan patient (and a month after China first officially notified the WHO of the pathogen's existence). A WHO delegation did not visit China to examine conditions on the ground until mid-February, after the organization had simply repeated a number of claims made by Beijing about the nature of the virus and the extent of its spread. Finally, it took until March 11, when the virus had infected over 100,000 people in over 100 countries around the world, before the WHO came around to calling the disease outbreak a pandemic.During the critical weeks and months when the virus began its spread in China and then around the world, the WHO seemed more interested in playing politics, rather than taking the actions that could have saved lives around the world.Defenders of the organization often argue that the WHO can only do what it is empowered to do; and that limits its ability to question the claims made by member states like China. If so, that's all the more reason for the U.S. to demand accountability for the hundreds of millions of dollars we send to the WHO. The organization should be reformed from within, so that it has the authority to conduct independent and rigorous examinations of claims made by its members - particularly when millions of lives are potentially at risk.While American funding to the WHO is paused, President Trump should convene a panel of public health experts both within and outside of government that can examine the questions asked here, as well as the WHO's practices more generally. The panel should make recommendations regarding organizational improvements, but might also look for ways for the U.S. to work with other international organizations, or countries around the world, to promote public health.Indeed, if the WHO is broken beyond repair, it may ultimately be time for us to consider creating a new organization to do the important work of improving health outcomes and preventing disease around the world.The coronavirus crisis has demonstrated the dangers of allowing an international organization like the WHO to fall under the influence of a single country that put its national interest above the greater good. We should not waste this opportunity to bring about the lasting, positive changes that will ultimately save lives and improve public health not just here, but around the world as well.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "opinion", "world-health-organization", "health", "infectdis"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 10:08:58", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 10:10:28"}

The company said farmers would be \"fairly compensated\" for the chickens.A representative for Allen Harim was not immediately available for further comment.PETA, meanwhile, has already reached out to Minton in an open letter published to the animal-rights organization's website, asking her to mandate that the chickens be killed as humanely as possible, and using methods approved by the American Veterinary Medical Associaton for \"non-emergencies.\"\"These millions of chickens don't deserve be tossed into an old wood chipper or struck with a two-by-four, as PETA has documented in other 'depopulation' efforts,\" said Daphna Nachminovitch, PETA's senior vice president of cruelty investigations, in a that accompanied the letter. \"The law, veterinary guidance, and common decency all mandate that the chickens receive the quickest and least cruel death possible.\"Meanwhile, experts and executives in the meat-industry continue to be concerned over the effect of the coronavirus on the nation's supply chain for food.Earlier this week, the president and CEO of Smithfield Foods, one of the nation's largest meat-processing companies, has warned of \"severe, perhaps disastrous\" consequences for the country's meat supply chain following the closure of its South Dakota plant -- and several other meat-processing plants -- due to outbreaks of the novel . \"The closure of this facility, combined with a growing list of other protein plants that have shuttered across our industry, is pushing our country perilously close to the edge in terms of our meat supply,\" Kenneth M. Sullivan, of Smithfield, said in a issued on Sunday.The Delmarva Poultry Industry, a trade association with members in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, told the Delaware News Journal it was also growing concerned after Allen Harim's \"depopulation\" news.\"The impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. chicken industry is becoming more apparent as the disease continues to spread throughout the United States,\" said Holly Porter, the executive director of Delmarva.", "tags": ["food", "food-drink", "coronavirus", "outbreaks"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 09:09:49", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 09:48:55"}

Trump announced Tuesday that the United States for putting \"political correctness over lifesaving measures\" and failing to keep the international community apprised of the threat in the early stages of the outbreak. \"The WHO failed in its basic duty and must be held accountable,\" Trump said at a White House press conference. \"The outbreak could have been contained at its source.\"Speaking at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China has \"serious concerns\" about Trump's move to revoke financial support for the WHO during times of crisis, according to Bloomberg.\"This U.S. decision will weaken the WHO's capabilities and undermine international cooperation,\" Zhao said. \"China will, as always, support the WHO in playing an important role in international public health and global anti-epidemic response.\" Zhao has been for leading a Chinese propaganda campaign, purposely about the origin of the novel COVID-19 illness. In its investigative report published in late February, WHO determined coronavirus originated in the city of Wuhan in the Chinese Hubei province. At the White House coronavirus news briefing in the Rose Garden Tuesday, Trump also declared that the United States would undertake a 60- to 90-day investigation into why the \"China-centric\" WHO had caused \"so much death\" by \"severely mismanaging and covering up\" the coronavirus' spread, including by making the \"disastrous\" decision to oppose travel restrictions on China. The U.S. is WHO's largest single donor, and the State Department had previously planned to provide the agency $893 million in the current two-year funding period. Trump said the United States contributes roughly $400 million to $500 million per year to WHO, while China offers only about $40 million. The money saved will go to areas that \"most need it,\" Trump asserted.The American Medical Association immediately called on Trump to reconsider his decision.\"During the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating COVID-19 easier,\" AMA President Patrice A. Harris said in a statement. \"Cutting funding to the WHO, rather than focusing on solutions, is a dangerous move at a precarious moment for the world.\"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres responded to Trump's decision by saying now is not the time to end support for the WHO due to its \"absolutely critical\" global effort to combat COVID-19, adding that the appropriate time for a review is \"once we have finally turned the page on this pandemic,\" according to the Associated Press.On Wednesday, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates said pulling American financial backing for WHO during a pandemic was \"as dangerous as it sounds.\" \"Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds,\" Gates said in Tweet Wednesday. \"Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever.\"Ashish Jha, the director of Harvard University's Global Health Institute, admitted Tuesday that WHO has failed in its response to outbreaks in the past, but said pulling funding now as it responds to the outbreak is an \"extraordinarily bad decision.\" \"Yes, @WHO is imperfect and we should hold it to account for missteps in the way it dealt with China. But now is not the time,\" Ashish Jha, the director of Harvard University's Global Health Institute, said on Twitter Tuesday. \"It will make the world worse off. It will make America worse off. This is an extraordinarily bad decision.\" \"I have a long history of criticizing @WHO when they mess up,\" he continued in a follow-up tweet. \"I blamed WHO for catastrophic response to Ebola in 2014. I criticized WHO for naming [Zimbabwe's Robert] Mugabe a health ambassador. But current scapegoating of WHO is exactly that. Scapegoating. And the losers will be the American people.\" Given Congress authorizes disbursements for WHO, several House Democrats challenged whether Trump had the authority to halt its funding, comparing the decision to his threat to pull support from Ukraine - a subject that launched an impeachment probe last year. \"In a desperate attempt to deflect blame, President Trump is threatening to violate the same spending laws that brought about his impeachment,\" House Appropriations Committee spokesman Evan Hollander said in a statement, according to . \"The president does not have the unilateral authority to withhold the United States' assessed contribution to the World Health Organization.\"Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., also called the president's move \"so stupid and so dangerous.\"\"The World Health Organization leads and coordinates the fight against pandemics. It's what they do,\" Beyer said on Twitter. \"You don't stop firefighters from doing their jobs during a five-alarm fire.\" Trump argued that WHO ignored \"credible information\" in December 2019 that the virus could be transmitted from human to human, as well as recommended against travel bans in January - around the same time he chose to curb flights from China for non-American travelers. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the U.S. and a key member of Trump's coronavirus task force, has said misinformation from China, repeated by WHO, had affected U.S. response efforts.Republican Sens. Martha McSally of Arizona and Rick Scott of Florida have claimed WHO worked with China in its alleged effort to cover-up and downplay the extent of the outbreak, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., vowed to cut funding in the next appropriations bill.", "tags": ["world"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 08:59:05", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 09:32:31"}

Still, Hansen is hopeful that blue-collar workers will ultimately be able to get back on their feet and thrive once again.Hansen spoke to Fox News about what fans can expect from \"Deadliest Catch: Bloodline,\" how he's coping with isolation and the sailing superstitions he takes seriously.What advice would you give to the blue-collar workers who are being affected right now by the coronavirus outbreak?Well, I hate to use an analogy with fishing, but I'm going to go there. We've had our seasons where it's up and down. Honestly, I've gone for months without making a dime. We've done that to where we've been in the middle of nowhere and had nothing to show for it.As far as being confined, we've been there. We've been confined for weeks or months, responsible for each other's lives and the lives of our own. We've been out there for weeks and months, rationing food. We've had no communications with the outside world, back when I was younger. So as far as this corona, I lived the corona lifestyle.That being said, I think that for us, we had a common goal and we would suffer through it and then we'd make it up on the next season. And this to me is far worse than what I've ever been through because this is a global pandemic, and I would just say you've got to keep your chin up. For those who are out of work, I shed tears right now for those people that are alone and out of work.But you've got to just muddle through at this time. There's no other answer. I just don't know how else to explain myself, but just keep your chin up because it will turn around. I think patience is going to be your best friend. Just try to be patient, because I know people are climbing the walls and going out of their minds, and it's not fair. It really isn't.You've talked about how crab fishing can be a very isolating job. How difficult is it to be separated from your family for such a long time out at sea? That's the thing. With the virus floating around, I'm hearing a lot of complaining and I understand. I have sympathy for the folks that are out of work, I have sympathy for the folks that are home alone. I shed tears for those people right now. We were fortunate enough to just finish up our season, so at least we accumulated a paycheck.Now I have to wait until summer for our next season to start. And so we have no guarantees ourselves if and when we can fish. That being said, if they're sitting at home crying that, \"I can't go on a date,\" or, \"I can't go to a restaurant,\" or, \"I don't get to go to a movie,\" well I don't have a lot of sympathy for that right now. Being isolated on a boat for weeks or months on end is no different. We've rationed food, we've run out of food on these things.I've gone for... What the heck was it? Two weeks without water. So, I don't want to sound like a mean guy, but this is a small price to pay for the rest of your life. And that's how I look at it. It's like a real tough fishing trip. It's a small price to pay when you look at the big picture. The big picture is you've got to get through it, and if you don't get to go see your boyfriend or your girlfriend, suck it up.There are a lot of young guys out there who want to get into fishing. What would you tell them? Well, I think if you're the type of guy that wants to make a quick buck up in Alaska, my hat's off to you because that's the right attitude. It really is. It doesn't come easy. You can't take it for granted and there's much more than meets the eye. That's the only thing. Getting a job right now is difficult because our fleet went from roughly 50 boats to 60, 70 vessels because we've been rationalized. We have quota systems now, so there are fewer vessels. And the vessels that do have crews, those guys really want to keep their jobs.For someone that wants to get up there, I would say go to Dutch Harbor, start in the processing factories. At least you have a roof over your head. You've got food in your belly. And then a lot of times when you're there, timing. Right place right time. A lot of times, someone gets hurt or quits, you'll be in Dutch Harbor and then you'll be in that position to jump on board. So for the people that want to go up there and work, I just think it's fantastic. I think more people should go up there and participate because the whole blue-collar industry is changing, right? And I love it when I hear that guys want to work with their hands. I love that. Was there ever a moment out at sea where things got so bad you honestly didn't believe you would make it?There have been several times in my career and my life where I didn't think I was going to make it, as far as surviving, especially with crab fishing. Over the years now or decades, I've put myself in some pretty scary situations. We've iced the boat down to the point where she was literally sinking under our feet. It took us roughly 16, 18 hours to get the ice off the boat, to get the boat right and upright.We've had situations where I had jobs on other vessels, and then for whatever reason, I didn't participate, and two days later the vessel leaves and they sank and were never to be seen again. And of course, I've had a heart attack at sea, right outside of Dutch Harbor and survived, so many more stories I could tell. I feel like a cat with nine lives. I just don't know what number I'm on right now, but I'm getting close here. So I'm very fearful. The older I get, the more fearful I am to participate. And that's honest. It's getting close to where I'm about done with this whole business.There are a lot of superstitions when it comes to fishing. Are there any that you actually take seriously?We take them all seriously. You've got to remember, I'm [a] fourth-generation fisherman, and my grandfather, he embedded this into my brain and I've thought about it many times. And it gets to the point where you're fearful. One of the superstitions is, for example, if you set a coffee cup upside down or if you open a can of beans or anything upside down, it simulates an upside-down vessel.

We need to review their role in helping Communist China lie about the #Coronavirus, before any more taxpayer money is spent,\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., tweeted. \"This was the right move and I look forward to a full Congressional investigation into the WHO.\"But the partisan divide quickly opened. Following the announcement, House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and House Subcommittee on National Security Chairman Steven Lynch, D-Mass., penned a letter to the president slamming his decision to withhold funding to the organization amid the global pandemic.\"While we may agree that the WHO has shortcomings that must be corrected, your attack on the global health organization can easily be seen as a deliberate but transparent effort to deflect responsibility for your own failures onto others,\" Maloney and Lynch wrote, adding that Trump's \"attempt to blame the WHO for trusting China reflects an astonishing level of hypocrisy given your own fawning and widely publicized praise of President Xi Jinping and his government for their handling of this crisis.\"They added: \"While the WHO may have made mistakes in its response to this crisis, it was certainly not alone, and it defies logic to withhold support from the WHO at this pivotal moment--at the height of a global pandemic--when promoting the health of nations around the world is essential to protecting our own population and rebuilding our own economy.\"Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., blasted the president's move as \"irresponsible, irrational and simply the wrong thing to do.\"Also late Tuesday, the American Medical Association weighed in, immediately calling on Trump to reconsider his decision.\"During the worst public health crisis in a century, halting funding to the World Health Organization is a dangerous step in the wrong direction that will not make defeating COVID-19 easier,\" AMA President Patrice A. Harris said in a statement.Meanwhile, international officials and bodies also weighed in, condemning the president's move.The European Union early Wednesday said Trump had \"no reason\" to freeze funding to WHO, especially at this critical stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and urged measures to instead promote unity.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the 27-nation bloc \"deeply\" regrets the suspension of funds and added that the U.N. health agency is now \"needed more than ever\" to combat the pandemic.Borrell added that \"only by joining forces can we overcome this crisis that knows no borders.\"United Nations' Secretary-General warned that the timing for the decision was wrong.\"It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against COVID-19,\" Guterres said, adding that \"it also not the time to reduce the resources for the operations of the World Health Organization or any other humanitarian organization in the fight against the virus.\"He added: \"Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis. The lessons learned will be essential to effectively address similar challenges, as they may arise in the future.\"And a foreign ministry spokesman for China also blasted the move, vowing to continue China's support.\"This U.S. decision will weaken the WHO's capabilities and undermine international cooperation,\" the spokesman said, according to .But Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison sympathized with Trump, noting that the WHO is \"not immune from criticism,\" but also saying that his country would not take the same steps.\"I sympathize with his criticisms and I've made a few of my own,\" Morrison told Perth Radio 6PR on Wednesday. \"WHO is also as an organization does a lot of important work, including here in our own region in the Pacific, and we work closely with them so we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here.\"He added, though, that WHO is \"not immune from criticism and immune from doing things better.\"The United States is the WHO's largest single donor, and the State Department had previously planned to provide the agency $893 million in the current two-year funding period. Trump said the United States contributes roughly $400 to $500 million per year to WHO, while China offers only about $40 million. The money saved will go to areas that \"most need it,\" Trump asserted.\"We have deep concerns over whether America's generosity has been put to the best use possible,\" Trump said Tuesday, accusing the WHO of failing to adequately keep the international community apprised of the threat of the coronavirus.\"The WHO failed in this duty, and must be held accountable,\" Trump said Tuesday. He added that the WHO had ignored \"credible information\" in December 2019 that the virus could be transmitted from human to human.Last week, Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, said the WHO and the Chinese Communist Party were \"co-conspirators\" in allegedly hiding information about the novel coronavirus in its early stages, and called it \"the worst cover-up in human history\" while calling for leadership of the WHO to step down.The Chinese government began news about the virus early on, and even detained , who has since died of coronavirus after trying to warn the international community of the threat. Nevertheless, on Jan. 8, the WHO declared: \".\"Again on Jan. 14, the WHO simply echoed Chinese government statements: \"\"By Jan. 19, the WHO had changed its tune somewhat, but still hedged. \"Not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted, the clinical features of the disease, the extent to which it has spread, or its source, which remains unknown.\" senior WHO officials suspected human-to-human transmission from the outset.Meanwhile, many lawmakers have called for WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to resign from his post amid the controversy.Last week, Tedros vehemently defended his agency amid criticism from Trump and others.\"If you don't want many more body bags you refrain from politicizing it -- please quarantine politicizing COVID,\" he told reporters, after Trump threatened to look at cutting funding to the organization.\"My short message is please quarantine politicizing COVID -- the unity of your country will be very important to defeat this dangerous virus. Without unity we assure you even any country that may have a better system will be in more trouble. That's our message,\" he said.He went on to urge a global response to the virus similar to the one that combated smallpox.\"The United States and China should come together and fight this dangerous enemy, they should come together to fight it and the rest of G-20 should come together to fight it, and the rest of the world should come together and fight it,\" he said.", "tags": ["whitehouse", "politics", "coronavirus"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 07:59:37", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 08:39:59"}

In fact, we expect the first checks to be in the mail early next week which is well in advance of when the first checks went out in 2008 and well in advance of initial estimates.\"Americans whose banking information the IRS has will not get the Trump-signed checks, and instead will receive a direct deposit that does not include Trump's name.

Trump has also blamed the World Health Organization for contributing to the seriousness of the pandemic by putting \"political correctness over lifesaving measures\" as it has often repeated China's claims on the communist nation's handling of the virus.Many on the left have criticized Trump for the decision to print his name on the stimulus checks.\"Delaying direct payments to vulnerable families just to print his name on the check is another shameful example of President Trump's catastrophic failure to treat this crisis with the urgency it demands,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement.\"If the check you're waiting for is delayed, you can thank this man,\" Harvard law professor Lawrence Tribe said in a tweet Wednesday morning. \"He cared more about getting his name on the check than about your need for it. He's worse than contemptible.\"The $2.2 trillion CARES Act, the name of the package that provides for the stimulus checks, is unlikely to be the last piece of legislation passed to combat the coronavirus, as Trump and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have indicated that they hope to pass potentially two more laws with total expenditures between them of possibly more than $2 trillion.

Even now, as so much about our society seems to be unraveling, hope for deliverance is taking shape. Everything is coming together on the Democratic side of the .That's good news, not just for , but for independents, and even for disaffected Republicans who are sick of the petulance and rancor that has replaced non-partisan expertise in our government.This week, as a nation housebound under lockdown turns to jigsaw puzzles for amusement, another big piece of the ticket has been put into place.Former President Barack Obama has formally endorsed Joe Biden to be the Democratic party's nominee, putting his stamp of approval on a candidate already chosen by an overwhelming number of Democratic voters.In a video released Tuesday, President Obama said that the man he chose to be his Vice President \"has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery.\"With our current leadership, so seemingly unable to experience the empathy that's needed in this challenging time, former President Obama noted that Joe Biden is \"someone whose own life has taught him how to persevere; how to bounce back when you've been knocked down.\"This is a candidacy that can appeal not just to every stripe of Democratic voter, but to independents who value judgment and prudence, and even Republicans who long for a return to the stability and norms that make American government function properly, especially in challenging times.President Obama made certain to give proper recognition to Biden's last challenger for the nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders. Obama said \"Bernie's an American original -- a man who has devoted his life to giving voice to working people's hopes, dreams, and frustrations,\" and rightfully pointed out that \"the ideas he's championed; the energy and enthusiasm he inspired, especially in young people, will be critical in moving America in a direction of progress and hope.\"Indeed, Bernie Sanders himself added a vital piece to the Democratic jigsaw puzzle just the day before, by issuing his own endorsement of Joe Biden. The two appeared together in a live-streamed video, with Sanders telling Biden \"We need you in the White House,\" and Biden responding that \"I'm going to need you. Not just to win the campaign, but to govern.\" Were both of them being careful to say exactly the right things at the right time? Yes. Is that an important skill in this unsettled time? Absolutely!Bernie and Biden may have been the last two candidates standing, but they started out a year ago in a Democratic field that eventually numbered over two dozen. The quality of that batch of candidates was easily the match for any in the history of this nation. As Obama noted in his endorsement of Biden, \"Each of our candidates were talented and decent, with a track record of accomplishment, smart ideas, and serious visions for the future.\"Beyond that, they were by far the most diverse set of presidential aspirants ever, with candidates representing the African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and LGBQT communities. Half a dozen were women. And they represented every corner of this nation, from Hawaii to New England, with backgrounds in every level of government as well as impressive private sector experience. Any of them can be expected to contribute to a Biden presidency and to other Democratic administrations in the future.They were equally as diverse in the approaches they took to solving the problems vexing this nation, with voices careful and prudent as well as progressive and passionate. You can be sure that a Biden administration would have room for all of those voices to be heard and respected.And that's because, underneath the variety of policy approaches, every one of those candidates shares the core values of the Democratic Party. Those values include a fervent belief that quality, affordable healthcare is a right for all Americans, a devotion to protecting our planet and the environment, a commitment to a strong defense bolstered by close cooperation with our long-time allies, the vital importance of voting rights, and an economy that works for everyone.Those are the values that candidate Joe Biden is bringing to the race. And his candidacy will also reflect the diversity that was so important to the 2020 Democratic field--Joe has already pledged that his VP choice will be a woman.This is a candidacy that can appeal not just to every stripe of Democratic voter, but to independents who value judgment and prudence, and even Republicans who long for a return to the stability and norms that make American government function properly, especially in challenging times.Donald Trump will not be easy to defeat. There are institutional advantages to incumbency, even when the bragging rights that would have gone with an effectively-managed first term have been utterly squandered.But underpinning the previously mentioned core Democratic values, are an even deeper set of values that all Americans hold in common--a love for this country and for all of its people that transcends party differences, a commitment to treating everyone with dignity and respect, and an appreciation for the professionalism and expertise that are so vital in making America function.Those are things that have been sadly neglected as of late, but which have always been vital elements of the American spirit in all of us. I think that people of all political persuasions are ready to return to a way of life that fosters those values.I believe that this country is more than ready to join with Joe Biden and the Democratic Party, as we simultaneously re-embrace the hallowed traditions of the past, and join those traditions with a fresh hope for a bright future of recovery, safety, prosperity, and growth.", "tags": ["2020-presidential-election", "opinion", "joe-biden", "barack-obama", "bernie-sanders"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 08:13:33", "modified_time": "2020-04-17 08:48:14"}

Her work in Washington, in Massachusetts, and on the campaign trail has made a real difference in people's lives.

And treat you with respect, no matter where you're coming from.\"Warren - who was a co-front-runner with Biden for the nomination late last summer and early autumn - saw her fortunes wane after intense scrutiny from the media and incoming fire at the debates from her rivals over her record and her explanations on how she would implement and pay for her proposals for a government-run single-payer \"Medicare-for-all\" health care system.Her downward spiral intensified in February, after a very disappointing fourth-place finish in neighboring New Hampshire, followed by distant finishes in Nevada's caucuses and the primary in South Carolina. Three days later, she failed to win any of the 14 contests that were held on Super Tuesday.

There should be a record [of their visits],\" the insider told the outlet without providing any more details on the alleged bathhouse.The insider claimed that the establishment's records may be subpoenaed in Smollett's upcoming trial on charges of disorderly conduct. However, Abel and Ola have previously sued Smollett's lawyers Tina Glandian and Mark Geragos for defamation after they publicly implied one of them was in a sexual relationship with Smollett. The suit noted that such comments are potentially harmful to the Nigerian brothers' families due to the country's inhumane laws regarding homosexuality. Page Six reports that it is punishable by up to 14 years in prison or death by stoning if the person is married.\"We have sat back and watched lie after lie being fabricated about us in the media only so one big lie can continue to have life. These lies are destroying our character and our reputation in our personal and professional lives,\" their attorney, Gloria Schmidt Rodriguez, read in a statement on their behalf at the time. In a statement to Fox News on Wednesday, Rodriguez said that the Osundairos \"have no interest in bringing further attention to false statements\" and that \"they urge anyone interested in the facts of this lawsuit to read the court documents.\"According to Rodriguez, the \"case was not dismissed.\"Meanwhile, Jussie, remains embattled over the alleged hoax, having to expanded charges earlier this year.Smollett told police that two masked men attacked him as he was walking home in the early hours of Jan. 29, 2019. He said they made racist and homophobic insults, beat him and looped a noose around his neck before fleeing, and that at least one of his attackers was a white man who told him he was in \"MAGA country,\" a reference to President Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"Weeks later, police alleged Smollett paid two black friends to help stage the attack because he was unhappy with his salary as an actor on \"Empire,\" a Fox series filmed in Chicago that follows a black family as they navigate the ups and downs of the recording industry.", "tags": ["jussie-smollet", "entertainment", "celebrity", "incourt"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 08:04:28", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 19:42:34"}

The world needs @WHO now more than ever.\"Gates, who is worth some $104 billion, according to , has focused nearly all of his energy on public health responses since he in March he was stepping down from the board of directors of Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on philanthropy.In February, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation up to $100 million to help fight against the virus, $20 million of which went toward groups such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO. Earlier this month, Gates \"Fox News Sunday\" the current pandemic is \"a nightmare scenario,\" but said social distancing and a strong national response can keep casualties low.

Here's the truth about her", "content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.My mother, (1924-2016), did it her way. Whether it was in her role as a wife, mother, author or as a leader in the socio-political movement, she forged a new path.Some consider her a contradiction because she advocated publically for the and home during a time when some women in the public eye were campaigning for personal autonomy and self-centered professional advancement. But thousands of women were inspired by her fierce public advocacy for the homemaker, and she became the sweetheart of our nation's silent majority.Phyllis did what was thought by some to be revolutionary, or maybe better said -- . She challenged the established political and social classes, and more importantly the elites. Phyllis always did what she felt needed to be done. She did not wait for approval from anyone. She saw that no one was publically speaking for the majority of women - wives and mothers - so Phyllis Schlafly spoke for these women who she knew valued and prioritized being wives and mothers. To me, she was always \"my mom\" but to so many others she was a powerful defender and an advocate of who they were or what they aspired to be.Currently, there are those on the Left and in Hollywood who still feel threatened by what Phyllis stood for and what she accomplished in her life. So much so, that a new FX/Hulu show \"Mrs. America\" is premiering on April 15. Hollywood wants to re-write history and distort the legacy and hard work Phyllis did to pave the way for American conservatives. To this day, many women, and even men, who lead the conservative movement walk on the trails blazed first by Phyllis Schlafly. Progressives understand this and therefore want to diminish her influence, even years after her death.Any attack on the integrity of Phyllis Schlafly is, at its heart, an attack on the women who followed her. Women were attracted to her because she had the guts to stand up for her beliefs and the beliefs exuded by women who didn't feel pressured to be something they didn't want to be. Plus, she was always gracious and smiling. She modeled civility in dissent. She never called anyone a bad name and she never lost her composure. She used facts, not emotion, to win arguments. She carried herself in the exact opposite of what Hollywood is now trying to depict her as. They will, of course, highlight her strengths and portray them as weaknesses. But what they will do will backfire. She was always and forever grace under fire.She stood in the line of social fire because she believed in her causes and believed that God gave her a purpose and a mission for her life. She wanted her life to matter and she wanted to make a difference. Also - and this is important for understanding her - Phyllis loved the fights and the battles. She loved every moment of the spotlight. Yes, she had an enormous ego and very little humility, but she also earned her own attention. She was never a victim and she believed that feminism taught women to be victims.I learned from my mother that, no matter the odds, I could achieve. She taught me to stand up straight and to stand up for myself. She taught me never to be intimidated by anyone.More importantly, my mom was proud of the \"R\" in Mrs. She absolutely enjoyed being a wife. She loved being Mrs. J. Fred Schlafly. She felt strongly that feminism and its empty promises were ruining the sacred bond between husband and wife. Phyllis Schlafly was Mrs. Schlafly and it is an honor to call her Mrs. America. She was our Mrs. America - representing women who considered their most important job to be a wife and mother.I learned from my mother that, no matter the odds, I could achieve. I am often asked, \"did your mother teach you how to cook?\" Yes. and she taught me so much more: How to think, behave and write. She taught me to stand up straight and to stand up for myself. She taught me never to be intimidated by anyone - including herself. And I never was intimidated by my mother. If there is a criticism that rings true, many people considered Phyllis herself to be very intimidating. True, she was always firm and confident in her convictions, which made some on the outside looking in, uneasy. But to those who knew her, she was never intimidating because she welcomed frank conversations. She was adept at mentoring and encouraging young women. She did not stand on ceremony but expected that everyone would call her \"Phyllis.\"My mother's life has and always will be a role model for women. She was not perfect, of course; she made mistakes, but she learned from her mistakes and she never let any misstep slow her down.The most important trait I inhabited from her was grit and tenacity. Phyllis Schlafly was effective because she was committed, confident and firm. She never stopped fighting for our values and I am extremely honored to continue her historic work.", "tags": ["politics", "opinion"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 12:10:57", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 08:00:38"}

But by that time, more than 3,000 people had been infected during almost a week of public silence, according to internal documents obtained by The Associated Press and expert estimates based on .Six days.That delay, from January 14 to January 20, was neither the first mistake made by Chinese officials at all levels in confronting the outbreak, nor the longest lag, as governments around the world have dragged their feet for weeks and even months in addressing the virus.But the delay by the first country to face the new coronavirus came at a critical time -- the beginning of the outbreak. China's attempt to walk a line between alerting the public and avoiding panic set the stage for a pandemic that has infected almost 2 million people and taken more than 126,000 lives.\"This is tremendous,\" said Zuo-Feng Zhang, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"If they took action six days earlier, there would have been much fewer patients and medical facilities would have been sufficient. We might have avoided the collapse of Wuhan's medical system.\" Other experts noted that the Chinese government may have waited on warning the public to stave off hysteria, and that it did act quickly in private during that time.But the six-day delay by China's leaders in Beijing came on top of almost two weeks during which the national Center for Disease Control did not register any cases from local officials, internal bulletins obtained by the AP confirm. Yet during that time, from January 5 to January 17, hundreds of patients were appearing in hospitals -- not just in Wuhan, but across the country.It's uncertain whether it was local officials who failed to report cases or national officials who failed to record them. It's also not clear exactly what officials knew at the time in Wuhan, which only opened back up last week with restrictions after its quarantine.But what is clear, experts say, is that China's rigid controls on information, bureaucratic hurdles and a reluctance to send bad news up the chain of command muffled early warnings. broadcast on national television on January 2, sent a chill through the city's hospitals.\"Doctors in Wuhan were afraid,\" said Dali Yang, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Chicago. \"It was truly intimidation of an entire profession.\"Without these internal reports, it took the first case outside China, in Thailand on January 13, to galvanize leaders in Beijing into recognizing the possible pandemic before them. It was only then that they launched a nationwide plan to find cases -- distributing CDC-sanctioned test kits, easing the criteria for confirming cases and ordering health officials to screen patients, all without telling the public. The Chinese government has repeatedly denied suppressing information in the early days, saying it immediately reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization.\"Allegations of a cover-up or lack of transparency in China are groundless,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a Thursday press conference._________________________The documents show that the head of China's National Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, laid out a grim assessment of the situation on January 14 in a confidential teleconference with provincial health officials. A memo states that the teleconference was held to convey instructions on the coronavirus from President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, but does not specify what those instructions were.\"The epidemic situation is still severe and complex, the most severe challenge since SARS in 2003, and is likely to develop into a major public health event,\" the memo cites Ma as saying.The National Health Commission is the top medical agency in the country. In a faxed statement, the Commission said it had organized the teleconference because of the case reported in Thailand and the possibility of the virus spreading during New Year travel. It added that China had published information on the outbreak in an \"open, transparent, responsible and timely manner,\" in accordance with \"important instructions\" repeatedly issued by President Xi.The documents come from an anonymous source in the medical field who did not want to be named for fear of retribution. The AP confirmed the contents with two other sources in public health familiar with the teleconference. Some of the memo's contents also appeared in , stripped of key details and published in February.Under a section titled \"sober understanding of the situation,\" the memo said that \"clustered cases suggest that human-to-human transmission is possible.\" It singled out the case in Thailand, saying that the situation had \"changed significantly\" because of the possible spread of the virus abroad.\"With the coming of the Spring Festival, many people will be traveling, and the risk of transmission and spread is high,\" the memo continued. \"All localities must prepare for and respond to a pandemic.\" In the memo, Ma demanded officials unite around Xi and made clear that political considerations and social stability were key priorities during the long lead-up to China's two biggest political meetings of the year in March. While the documents do not spell out why Chinese leaders waited six days to make their concerns public, the meetings may be one reason.\"The imperatives for social stability, for not rocking the boat before these important Party congresses is pretty strong,\" says Daniel Mattingly, a scholar of Chinese politics at Yale. \"My guess is, they wanted to let it play out a little more and see what happened.\"In response to the teleconference, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing initiated the highest-level emergency response internally, Level One, on January 15. It assigned top CDC leaders to 14 working groups tasked with getting funds, training health workers, collecting data, doing field investigations and supervising laboratories, an internal CDC notice shows. The memo directed Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, to begin temperature checks at airports, bus and train stations, and cut down on large public gatherings.The National Health Commission also distributed a 63-page set of instructions to provincial health officials, obtained by the AP. The instructions ordered health officials nationwide to identify suspected cases, hospitals to open fever clinics, and doctors and nurses to don protective gear. They were marked \"internal\" -- \"not to be spread on the Internet,\" \"not to be publicly disclosed.\"Former Senior Adviser to the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 2016 Trump campaign Foreign Policy Advisor Kiron Skinner joins Jon Scott to discuss the W.H.O. and China relations to the U.S. amid slow COVID-19 response.In public, however, officials continued to downplay the threat, pointing to the 41 cases public at the time.\"We have reached the latest understanding that the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is low,\" Li Qun, the head of the China CDC's emergency center, . That was the same day Li was appointed leader of a group preparing emergency plans for the level one response, a CDC notice shows.On January 20, President Xi issued his first public comments on the virus, saying the outbreak \"must be taken seriously\" and every possible measure pursued. A leading Chinese epidemiologist, Zhong Nanshan, If the public had been warned a week earlier to take actions such as social distancing, mask-wearing and travel restrictions, cases could have been cut by up to two-thirds, . An earlier warning could have saved lives, said Zhang, the doctor in Los Angeles.However, other health experts said the government took decisive action in private given the information available to them.\"They may not have said the right thing, but they were doing the right thing,\" said Ray Yip, the retired founding head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's office in China. \"On the 20th, they sounded the alarm for the whole country, which is not an unreasonable delay.\"If health officials raise the alarm prematurely, it can damage their credibility -- \"like crying wolf\" -- and cripple their ability to mobilize the public, said Benjamin Cowley, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on holding China accountable for the coronavirus.The delay may support accusations by President that the Chinese government's secrecy held back the world's response to the virus. However, even the public announcement on January 20 left the U.S. nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic.During those months, , while the government and . Leaders across the world turned a blind eye to the outbreak, with British prime minister calling for a strategy of \"herd immunity\" -- Brazilian president _________________________The early story of the pandemic in China shows missed opportunities at every step, the documents and AP interviews reveal. Under Xi, China's most authoritarian leader in decades, increasing political repression has made officials more hesitant to report cases without a clear green light from the top.\"It really increased the stakes for officials, which made them reluctant to step out of line,\" said Mattingly, the Yale professor. \"It made it harder for people at the local level to report bad information.\"Doctors and nurses in Wuhan there were plenty of signs that the coronavirus could be transmitted between people as early as late December. Patients who had never been to the suspected source of the virus, the Huanan Seafood Market, were infected. Medical workers started falling ill.But officials obstructed medical staff who tried to report such cases. They set tight criteria for confirming cases, where patients not only had to test positive, but samples had to be sent to Beijing and sequenced. They required staff to report to supervisors before sending information higher, And they punished doctors for warning about the disease.As a result, , even as officials gathered in Wuhan for Hubei province's two biggest political meetings of the year, internal China CDC bulletins confirm. During this period, teams of experts dispatched to Wuhan by Beijing said they failed to find clear signs of danger and human-to-human transmission.\"China has many years of disease control; there's absolutely no chance that this will spread widely because of Spring Festival travel,\" the head of the first expert team, Xu Jianguo, on January 6. He added there was \"no evidence of human-to-human transmission\" and that the threat from the virus was low.The second expert team, dispatched on January 8, similarly failed to unearth any clear signs of human-to-human transmission. Yet during their stay, more than half a dozen doctors and nurses had already fallen ill with the virus, The teams looked for patients with severe pneumonia, missing those with milder symptoms. They also narrowed the search to those who had visited the seafood market -- which was in retrospect a mistake, said Cowling, the Hong Kong epidemiologist, who flew to Beijing to review the cases in late January.In the weeks after the severity of the epidemic became clear, some experts accused Wuhan officials of intentionally hiding cases.\"I always suspected it was human-to-human transmissible,\" said Wang Guangfa, the leader of the second expert team, in a March 15 post on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform. He fell ill with the virus soon after returning to Beijing on January 16.Wuhan's then-mayor, Zhou Xianwang, blamed national regulations for the secrecy.\"As a local government official, I could disclose information only after being authorized,\" Zhou told state media in late January. \"A lot of people didn't understand this.\"As a result, top Chinese officials appear to have been left in the dark.\"The CDC acted sluggishly, assuming all was fine,\" said a state health expert, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution. \"If we started to do something a week or two earlier, things could have been so much different.\" It wasn't just Wuhan. In Shenzhen in southern China, hundreds of miles away, a team led by microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung used their own test kits to confirm that six members of a family of seven had the virus on January 12. , a respected Chinese finance magazine, Yuen said he informed CDC branches \"of all levels,\" including Beijing. But internal CDC numbers did not reflect Yuen's report, the bulletins show.When the Thai case was reported, health authorities finally drew up an internal plan to systematically identify, isolate, test, and treat all cases of the new coronavirus nationwide.Wuhan's case count began to climb immediately -- four on January 17, then 17 the next day and 136 the day after. Across the country, dozens of cases began to surface, in some cases among patients who were infected earlier but had not yet been tested. In Zhejiang, for example, In Shenzhen, the patients Yuen discovered on January 12 were finally recorded as confirmed cases on Jan. 19.The elite Peking Union Medical College Hospital held an emergency meeting on January 18, instructing staff to adopt stringent isolation -- still before Xi's public warning. A health expert told AP that on January 19, she toured a hospital built after the SARS outbreak, where medical workers had furiously prepared an entire building with hundreds of beds for pneumonia patients.\"Everybody in the country in the infectious disease field knew something was going on,\" she said, declining to be named to avoid disrupting sensitive government consultations. \"They were anticipating it.\"", "tags": ["coronavirus", "world", "china"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 06:49:53", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 07:11:41"}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. has said that deciding when to reopen the economy will be the biggest and most difficult one he will make in his presidency.No one can deny the world is facing the most prolific challenge in our . Since World War II, we as a nation have never faced decisions of global consequence like the ones we are facing today. Yes, there have been conflicts abroad, terrorists' actions at home and even previous epidemics, but for nearly everyone alive today, we have never been asked as a country to make the really hard decisions this global pandemic now requires.The decision Trump has to make is not as simple as the health care or the governors of our states make it out to be. The decision is much more complex and the stakes are higher.In many respects, we are in the midst of a multi-front war. One is battling the virus, but others are perhaps even more dangerous; preserving the economy - and preserving our freedoms. And beyond the cliche that the cure could be worse than the disease, America's retreat from the world economy will cause untold death and turmoil across the globe.Prime Minister Winston Churchill made the difficult decision to fight on after the fall of France and not pursue, as some suggested, a negotiated settlement with Nazi Germany. He undoubtedly knew it would lead to incalculably more death and destruction. Yet, if preservation of life was the only consideration, perhaps capitulating to Nazi Germany would have been the easier decision.Franklin D. Roosevelt looked crisis in the eye and sent countless young, brave men to storm the beaches of Normandy to free a continent half a world away, and in doing so, preserved our freedoms as well.Do we as a nation have the courage for tough decisions? Are we mindful of the fragility of our prosperity and our liberties? Would we as Americans be willing to pay that price or sacrifice that much if those decisions of the past fell into the court of public opinion today?The book, \"Lessons in Tragedy,\" by Hal Brands and Charles Edel, gives us historical examples of how easily cultures have descended into violence and war. Further catastrophes were only averted by taking difficult, and understandably controversial, actions. The authors argue that America needs a \"tragic sensibility\" in order to address the dangers we face both domestically and internationally.There are far graver consequences which we as a nation will face long term if we don't make those same tough decisions of history and embrace our own sense of tragic sensibility by changing course soon and reopening sectors of our economy in a safe and strategic way.It was our industry, our economy and the arsenal of democracy that helped win World War II. In fact, the United States was the only nation to see its economy grow during the war. It was this same U.S. industry that allowed the execution of the post-war Marshall Plan and the formation of most of the global institutions that have led to the prosperity of the last 75 years.That same economy will be what propels our recovery following this crisis, but it cannot do so if it remains in a self-induced coma. It's time to wake America's sleeping giant of economic growth - before it's too late.Another front of this war involves not only preserving life, but also preserving our very way of life. From every side, we are under attack by China and their execution of unrestricted warfare - a strategy that describes winning a global war against the United States without ever firing a shot.Much has already been written about China's role in the coronavirus and concerns about lack of transparency, with much still to uncover. However, one thing is irrefutable. China is taking advantage of the crisis, profiting from the outbreak, continuing their predatory mercantilism and accelerating the provision of goods and services to many suffering from the pandemic, such as sending 1,000 ventilators to New York City and attempting to re-sell to Italy some of the very products Italy donated to China.China is also buying up distressed assets around the globe. The virus has become China's economic weapon to destroy the economies of the U.S. and its allies. So far, it has worked, but it has to stop. Immediately.Part of winning the fight on this front is pushing back on China with the full weight of the American economy, not just for ourselves, but for a world that also looks to our strength for their strength, security and stability. We need to win this war on many fronts: restarting the engine of industry and preserving the values and freedoms of our country, while also protecting ourselves against further exploitation by an ever-aggressive China. If we allow ourselves to make decisions based exclusively on limiting or eliminating potential American loss of life, we are fighting this war on only one front, which is a flawed and short-sighted strategy. We owe more to our nation, and to the world.President Trump's instincts are correct, and many of the steps our president has taken have been bold, brave and infused with informed guidance and personal wisdom. We need to support the president in making the tough, correct decision to reopen our economy as soon as it is safe to do so. This is not an either/or decision between choosing life or livelihood. Those are two parts of a complex, achievable balance that will protect our liberties as Americans and recalibrate our relationship with China.This is the perfect equilibrium our president must find, and we all must support, knowing there will continue to be risks, but being willing to assume those risks together.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "opinion", "health", "infectdis"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 14:36:37", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 07:00:18"}

It's about 30 people in there. [Recently] I got 230 text messages in one day from the cast and crew, so we're staying very closely in touch.\"The text group chat includes everyone from the cast to producers to makeup artists, grips, and the show's medical advisors. \"We are very tight with each other during a very tough time and are keeping updated as to what's going on here in New York City,\" Sims explained.The NBC series recently decided to pull an episode that was scheduled to air in April because it was about a deathly pandemic that hit the city. For obvious reasons the network and the showrunner believed it hit too close to home and they didn't want to capitalize on the current COVID-19 outbreak.Sims believed they made the right choice. \"I gotta tell you, even coming off of my last show -- 'The Last Ship' -- I did five seasons of the show that was about a pandemic. And I remember working on the show. It scared me and [I feel] the same when we're on 'New Amsterdam.' Sometimes I'd see a piece of the storyline and, you know, I'd see one of the writers and say, 'Was that true?' The writers are always drawing from real-life -- something that has happened or something that very well could happen.\"\"[New Amsterdam] does a good job of bringing these [topics] to the forefront and shining a light on some of the issues that we might be dealing with here. Even with the pandemic episode that we had to pull. It was just very, very close to home,\" he added.On Tuesday night, the series aired its final episode of the abbreviated season. Sims teased that the leftover episodes and storylines, which weren't finished, will most likely be rolled over into Season 3. \"We were glad to shut down production for safety reasons and to do our part to not spread the virus. That was our first concern,\" Sims said.\"We were devastated that we didn't get to finish the season in a proper way, but I'm pretty sure that they will come back with the storylines that we're missing and either will finish this season or we'll start the new season with some of these stories because they were fantastic,\" he continued. \"A lot of people were trying to figure out, for example, what's going on with my character. The last time we saw him, he left the hospital and was headed for San Francisco. People are wondering, is he gone for good?\"Reynolds' absence introduced fans to a new character, trauma surgeon Dr. Cassian Shin, played by , who tested positive for coronavirus but is on the road to recovery.\"I don't think Dr. Reynolds would like Dr. Shin's style much at all,\" Sims said. \"Dr. Shin is a bit unconventional.\"\"He comes in and he keeps you on the edge. You see the way that he handles his work. You know, he's nice but he doesn't go by the book,\" he added. \"He follows what's convenient for him but at the same time, he ultimately makes good decisions.\"Currently, \"New Amsterdam\" is set to return in the fall with new episodes.", "tags": ["exclusive", "entertainment", "tv", "coronavirus"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 15:37:51", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 07:00:09"}

Doug Collins, who has been one of President Trump's defenders through the impeachment process, announces he will run for U.S. Senate on 'Fox and Friends.' A pro- super PAC announced Wednesday that it is endorsing Rep. , R-Ga., for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat as the congressman continues his controversial to unseat incumbent Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., in a special election this November.The endorsement from Great America PAC, which boasts that it has \"raised and spent $40 million in support of Donald Trump's candidacy, presidency, and agenda,\" follows an endorsement of Collins earlier this week by Rep. Drew Ferguson, R-Ga., who became the first member of the Georgia congressional delegation to back Collins' Senate bid.Collins is seeking the seat vacated by retired Sen. Johnny Isakson at the end of 2019. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Loeffler to temporarily fill the seat late last year despite that President Trump appealed to him directly to him to appoint Collins instead. \"Georgians have seen the effective leadership of Doug Collins for years and the nation witnessed his strength and conviction during the partisan impeachment hearings of President Trump,\" Ed Rollins, the chairman of Great America PAC, said in a statement announcing the endorsement. He had indicated on Fox Business early that his PAC would eventually endorse Collins.Rollins' Great America PAC is one of a number of pro-Trump fundraising groups that are not authorized by Trump and which have been denounced by Trump and his representatives, according to . America First is the only super PAC authorized by the president.Rollins continued: \"Collins is exactly the type of leader Georgia needs in the U.S. Senate. In a very short time, Kelly Loeffler has proven she puts protecting her personal wealth before protecting her constituents. This type of behavior is exactly what's wrong with the DC swamp and must be rooted out.\"The incumbent Loeffler has run into some bad press lately as she is one of four senators who has come under fire for dumping large amounts of in the weeks before the coronavirus pandemic caused a crash in the U.S. stock market.Loeffler denies wrongdoing and says she did not have any knowledge of the stock sales at the time they happened, saying that her financial advisors make buying and selling decisions for her portfolio without her input. Insider trading by a member of Congress would be illegal under the 2012 STOCK Act. \"I'm informed only after those trades are made and I have nothing in terms of a say on what buys and sells are executed and what the timing is. I'm only advised after it happens -- almost concurrent with the public reporting that we do here,\" Fox News' Tucker Carlson late last month. More recently, Loeffler has said she would all her stock holdings amid the increased scrutiny following initial reports about her financial moves.Collins, who is taking the unusual step as a Republican of challenging an incumbent Republican, has run into his own opposition to his senate bid. The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), an organization dedicated to boosting the GOP majority in the Senate, came out hard against Collins when he first announced his run.\"The shortsightedness in this decision is stunning,\" NRSC Executive Director Kevin McLaughlin in a statement decrying the potential negative electoral consequences of the intra-party challenge after Collins first confirmed the Senate bid. \"Doug Collins' selfishness will hurt David Perdue, Kelly Loeffler, and President Trump.\"The NRSC released a digital ad in late February against Collins, highlighting the collegial southerner's friendships with top Democrats including Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Stacey Abrams, as well as his failing grade from the Conservative Review, a group which grades GOP members of Congress based on votes on selected bills.\"He's longtime friends with Stacey Abrams, anti-Trump impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries, and President Obama,\" the ad, which also highlights Collins' past criticism of Trump says. \"Don't let DC Doug Collins fool you, he'll do whatever it takes to get a promotion.\"Some of the representatives in the Conservative Review's rankings include Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio while some who received failing grades include Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y.The Georgia special election does not include primaries, instead pitting all candidates of all parties against each other on a single ballot in November. If no candidate secures more than 50 percent of the vote, there will be a runoff held in January to decide between the two top candidates -- a vote that has the potential to decide which party has the majority in the Senate until 2022.The race got off to an awkward start when Trump appeared to try to dissuade Collins from challenging Loeffler by Collins' name to be his permanent Director of National Intelligence. Collins said he would not accept the position, and proceeded with his Senate run against the wishes of the GOP establishment -- and apparently President Trump.But now as Loeffler struggles with bad publicity, Collins, who was one of Trump's staunchest defenders during the impeachment saga, is receiving support from high-profile Trump backers like Great America PAC.\"Great America PAC is one of President Trump's strongest supporters and I am very honored to earn their support in my run for the U.S. Senate,\" Collins said in a statement. \"They played a critical role in electing the President in 2016, and I am confident they will do the same for me in 2020.

But cracks in the honest and open theory are fast emerging. SARS is also a novel coronavirus that can mutate into varying strains and cause deadly respiratory problems. Many of its victims went from having mild flu-like symptoms to their death beds and battling to breathe in the span of a few days.So what happened all those years ago, and were lessons adequately learned and applied?The first recorded case of something amiss was noted in November 2002 by health officials in Guangzhou city, Guangdong Province, the presumed origin of the new pathogen. But it was not until more than three months later - in mid-February 2003 -- that China's leadership reported a new virus to WHO, acknowledging that there had already been 300 cases and five known deaths of the new disease.Just as evidence is starting to unfold of a Beijing cover-up, the Communist Party (CCP) leadership - then under President Hu Jintao - was similarly accused of hiding information, and the World Health Organization (WHO) was also skewered for inaction. But some experts note that they were working behind the scenes to build a file.According to Ken Mahoney, of the Wall Street-based risk firm Mahoney Asset Management, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a SARS, it failed to alert WHO, but WHO staff was monitoring Chinese medical message boards and eventually took all the information it had to China.\"However, in this crisis, reports of the virus were silenced for as long as six weeks, and action was not taken immediately. There is little doubt the WHO's silence has cost the world dearly, both economically and, more importantly, in lives lost,\" he observed. \"The SARS response was led by WHO leader Gro Harlem Brundtland, and she accused China back then of withholding information. The outbreak might have been contained if the WHO had been effective at their mission at an earlier stage and encouraged China to let them come in as quickly as possible.\" It was in February 2003 when China first acknowledged SARS, although hospitals are said to have reported a strange new pneumonia to authorities some three months earlier. Days after notification from Beijing, WHO internally activated its global influenza laboratory network and called for heightened global surveillance on Feb. 19, 2003.But even with a Beijing admission, it was two days later that the pathogen spread outside China's borders and killed hundreds.On February 21, a 64-year-old Chinese medical doctor who had treated patients in Guangzhou and was incubating SARS traveled to Hong Kong. Within a 24-hour period, he had unknowingly transmitted the disease to 16 other guests on his floor at the Metropole Hotel.The doctor fell gravely ill the following day and checked into a Hong Kong hospital, dying on March 4. The other infected guests - then with only mild symptoms - carried the virus to Toronto, Singapore, and Hanoi, or they entered hospitals in Hong Kong. A global outbreak was thus ignited. One of those guests, a businessman who went on to Hanoi and was admitted to the hospital on February 26, puzzled hospital staff so much that they allegedly reached out to the World Health Organization on February 28.On March 12, WHO finally sounded the global alarm about a mystery virus, two days after China requested laboratory support. Days later, a worldwide travel advisory was issued by the organization. From April, a number of other warnings were sent out, cautioning people to avoid all but essential travel to impacted areas, which generally consisted of mainland China, Hong Kong, Canada and Taiwan.Questions were quickly raised as to how and why the contagion was allowed to escape China's borders. At the time, WHO officials based out of headquarters in Switzerland sharply criticized China for withholding crucial information and keeping them in the dark, insisting that they acted as soon as they knew - but protocol prevents them from declaring travel warnings and health alerts until enough information has been gathered.Yet other critics contended that WHO missed or dismissed warning signs - including from local media cautioning of an odd new pneumonia and rapid purchasing of anti-viral medications - that should have been picked up by its 30-person Beijing office or its partner laboratories. Furthermore, more than a month before that fateful Hong Kong visit, a doctor in Guangdong is said to have sent a letter in late January to health professionals in other provinces, outlining the symptoms, lack of responsive treatment and urging quarantine measures for those exhibiting signs.WHO's decision-makers later claimed that they did not receive the memo.\"This was the first time a coronavirus had come to the attention as a pathogen that could spread around the world like this,\" Prof. David Heymann, who led WHO's infectious disease unit at the time of SARS, told the BBC. \"So, in the beginning, it wasn't known what it was, and nobody really looked for coronaviruses such as they are doing now.\"In April 2003, a well-known - and ultimately frustrated - Chinese doctor spoke out and accused the government of having obscured the virus. That month, an embarrassed China leadership apologized to the world and fired a number of health authorities, including its health minister and the mayor of Beijing, over their conduct. Similarly now, Beijing has axed several health and political figures in Hubei, where the current coronavirus started.At a June 2003 conference in Kuala Lumpur, Chinese officials claimed that less than 350 people had died and that the outbreak was contained in the first three months, mostly to its starting point of Guangzhou. It was \"Stage 2,\" health authorities vowed, three months after the first case that the \"downward trend\" was documented as a result of an improved national surveillance system. That system required measures such as daily temperature checks for children, tracing of the \"mobile population,\" and the sealing off of known SARS clusters.\"Information was shared with WHO and shared on a daily basis,\" authorities claimed.The CCP following the outbreak to improve its disease control system, establish an outbreak and alert system, and \"enhance international cooperation.\" It was not until July 5, 2003, that WHO SARS as an epidemic - eight months after the first case.But as the SARS pandemic died down, WHO's top-brass highlighted the importance of government transparency to avoid such a health crisis from retaking hold, and the CCP also pledged to combat the matter. Internally, it endeavored to establish a more robust surveillance system, creating an online channel that connects clinics and hospitals across the country to enable them to document cases in real time. The system was widely lauded by international health experts, and, while it was designed to avoid political interference, early admonitions of the current coronavirus were not submitted. Instead, it was through whistleblowers that information finally leaked out.Furthermore, geopolitical analysts have alleged that the Chinese government only bolstered its grip of the information flow following the SARS disaster.In 2006, one of the original Chinese physicians to have identified and worked on SARS decried the country's \"dangerous\" and \"unsanitary\" wet markets as a source of possible infection -- but the government failed to close them down. COVID-19 is believed to have stemmed from an infected bat at such a market in Wuhan, Hubei.In the end, SARS infected around 8,000 people across some 29 countries, with an approximate 10 percent mortality rate - killing 800. By June 2003, it was classified as a \"contained\" epidemic. It never reached \"pandemic\" levels - a far cry from coronavirus, which has infected some 2 million people and killed more than 125,000.With COVID-19, WHO was misled and kept at arms-length by China. They fell for China's version of events hook, line and sinker.Yet in the SARS , public health professionals proclaimed that WHO had become especially active in \"preparing for a possible return,\" concerned with \"laboratory preparedness and planning to ensure rapid, sensitive, and specific early diagnosis.The coronavirus that sparked SARS was later tracked to the feral civet cat, considered a delicacy by some. After the outbreak, China outlawed the slaughter and consumption of civet cats, and in early 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States issued an on the raccoon-like creatures.According to Sara Abiola, assistant professor of Health Policy & Management at Columbia University, the actions of WHO through the SARS calamity were bolder in the early phase.\"The WHO took these actions even though they did not have formal authority to do so at the time and publicly criticized China,\" she noted. \"Essentially, the WHO has even more avenues now through which to attempt to help control the global spread of infectious diseases now than it did during the SARS outbreak. However, no matter what the WHO mandates, it will always be limited by the sovereignty of its Member States and its budget. Its budget is not commensurate with its responsibilities; WHO controls only 30 percent of its budget, and Member States have co-opted WHO's agenda through earmarked funds.\"Moreover, analysts highlight that WHO back then was not afraid to condemn China's obscuring ways, as the blatant lack of transparency from the country angered leaders around the world.\"With SARS, WHO stepped in and took charge by demanding data and action, and China complied. Because WHO aggressively intervened in China with the SARS outbreak, WHO was largely praised for preventing a global pandemic,\" contended Summer McGee, dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of New Haven. \"With COVID-19, WHO was misled and kept at arms-length by China.

Martha McSally: Coronavirus will be defeated by health care heroes - we must get them what they need", "content": "Phil Keating reports on how technology is being innovated to keep first responders safe.The United States is in the midst of an all-hands-on-deck war against , with our amazing health care heroes serving on the front lines of this battle.Despite the incredible risks, first responders, nurses, doctors, other care professionals - plus additional hospital employees such as janitors and food service staff - continue to report for duty to serve our communities across the country as this pandemic has rapidly advanced.The past several weeks have ushered in extraordinary times, with the coronavirus altering life as we know it. Most Americans now have a duty to help slow the spread of this disease by staying home and practicing social distancing. But not all Americans.Our health care heroes are in the field working overtime to protect us against a virus that has no known treatment or vaccine. They report for duty day after day and expose themselves to this invisible enemy while keeping hospitals running and open to new patients.These men and woman courageously follow their calling to save the lives of those battling coronavirus while also delivering babies, mending broken arms and administering chemotherapy to patients fighting cancer.At the same time, hospitals and other medical providers across the U.S. have faced critical shortages of crucial equipment like testing supplies, masks and gowns. These shortages have put doctors, nurses, and other front line workers at a greater risk of contracting the coronavirus, raising anxiety among medical professionals as they treat an increasing number of patients.Still, these heroes power through.In my home state of Arizona, doctors and nurses have made the tough decision of isolating from their own families amid personal protective equipment shortages as they work around the clock to keep families safe.Scottsdale cardiac anesthesiologist Reza Kharrazi recently shared a to rally his staff and other health care workers in the state who are anxious about their own exposure to the virus.Some doctors have even gotten creative. Phoenix emergency room physician Dr. Ben Reeser responded to mask shortages at his hospital by that allows doctors and nurses who have to intubate patients to do so without the risk of contracting the coronavirus.As a former combat fighter pilot, it seems inconceivable to me to have to face down an enemy without a parachute or fuel in your plane. But our health care heroes have risen to the fight as warriors with servant hearts. I salute their courage, grit, tireless dedication and selflessness.Meanwhile, I'm doing everything in my power to get them what they need to prevail in this war, which they will.With my help, Congress passed the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act last month, which includes several provisions intended to bolster our health care system.This legislation provides billions of additional dollars to the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health for various efforts, including:to ensure they continue to receive the support they need for coronavirus-related expenses. of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other medical supplies for federal and state response efforts. and response activities. related to the coronavirus. for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services began to deliver the initial $30 billion to hospitals and health care providers.The CARES Act also limits the liability for volunteer health care professionals, prioritizes Food and Drug Administration reviews of certain drugs for the coronavirus, allows the emergency use of certain diagnostic tests that are not approved by the FDA, expands health insurance coverage for diagnostic testing, and requires health insurance coverage for preventative services and vaccines.In addition to the CARES Act, I also cosponsored legislation to provide emergency financial assistance to rural health care facilities and providers impacted by this crisis.We are not helpless as individuals to help these heroes. Last week, I donated blood at the American Red Cross Donation Center in Tucson, where I had the honor of meeting several staff members who are responding to blood shortages.These employees are working tirelessly to collect blood as social distancing efforts and canceled blood drives have left hospitals with a scarce supply, which is still needed for trauma victims, cancer patients, organ transplants, or childbirth complications.If you are healthy, make an appointment to give blood today. If you have recovered from the coronavirus, you may be eligible to donate blood plasma containing antibodies that could help save someone else's life.It is because of the dedicated service and sacrifice of our health care heroes and first responders that the rest of us are able to focus on the wellbeing of our families and neighbors.In return, we should stand strong behind these individuals and help make their lives a little easier where we can by providing services like child care, grocery shopping, or other actions to minimize their stress.We are living in unprecedented times. Unlike the enemies I fought against in uniform, this enemy is invisible - but it is just as deadly.Yet the diligent efforts of our medical professionals who wake up every day and head to the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus will lead us to victory. I salute you. Our country will prevail in this battle because of selfless heroes like you.", "tags": ["america-together", "opinion", "arizona", "health", "coronavirus", "infectdis", "congress"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 00:52:57", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 06:00:22"}

The sport and its arena are entirely different from seating in a stadium. The PGA Tour, when it was still trying to keep playing, had already laid out guidelines for not having fans at tournaments -- a walking scorer, limited marshals on each hole, a reduced service staff.Waugh said the PGA Championship doesn't officially have a contingency plan, which is not to suggest tournament officials haven't given thought to how the summer could play out. He said they were having constant conversation with San Francisco city leaders on the status of the new coronavirus.\"If they were to pull the plug, we would have a drop-dead date,\" he said.Waugh did not say what that date would be, and he said the PGA of America so far was \"feeling good about the city's willingness\" to stage the event.Sergio Garcia now is part of his own foursome, and the timing couldn't have worked out any better.Garcia took to to announce his wife, Angela, gave birth to their second child on April 10, which would have been the second round of the Masters that was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.A son, Enzo Akins Garcia, was born at 6:25 p.m. Friday, and the Spaniard said mother and baby were doing well.His daughter, Azalea, was born in 2018, a year after Garcia won the Masters in a playoff over Justin Rose.Bernhard Langer is the only player to the win the Masters and then win the following week, beating Bobby Wadkins in a playoff at Hilton Head.And then there's Greg Norman.He was tied for the lead in the 1986 Masters with Jack Nicklaus until Norman sent his 4-iron into the gallery right of the 18th green, made bogey and finished one shot behind. Norman headed for Hilton Head and was tied for the lead until Fuzzy Zoeller birdied the last hole for a one-shot victory, giving Norman back-to-back runner-up finishes. One hurt more.Norman won at Hilton Head two years later by making up a four-shot deficit with a 66 for a one-shot victory.The day golf was canceled, Bernd Wiesberger of Austria caught the last flight out to get home.Rafa Cabrera Bello did not.The Spaniard told he decided not to fly to his home in Dubai in case it was difficult to return. He's been staying in a rented house in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida -- not far from Commissioner Jay Monahan -- ever since.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.With the spotlight on her growing ever brighter, Sabrina Ionescu is aware she's becoming her own brand.One of the most decorated players in women's college basketball, Ionescu is about to go pro with the WNBA draft coming up Friday. She's widely expected to be selected No. 1 by the New York Liberty.She's also being courted by shoe companies for what could be an unprecedented endorsement deal. On top of it all, she's finishing her master's degree, fittingly in advertising and brand responsibility.Ionescu said Oregon has prepared her to understand how much impact she can have in the community and on women's basketball.\"It's going to be a learning process of just going into a bigger market with so many things going on. And I think I'm just going to have to find my niche and find what's important to me and what's going to help me -- and our team -- and kind of use that to the best of my ability,\" she said on a video call with reporters Tuesday.Ionescu, who won AP All-American honors three times, shattered the NCAA career triple-double mark (for both men and women) with 26 and became the first player in college history to have 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds and 1,000 assists.She helped the Ducks win the Pac-12 regular-season and tournament titles as a senior this season while averaging 17.5 points, 9.1 assists and 8.6 rebounds. She was named the conference's most outstanding player of the tournament and of the regular season.The 5-foot-11 guard was also named AP Player of the Year and won the Wooden Award, the Naismith Trophy and Wade Trophy.So it's no wonder shoe companies have flocked to her. Nike, which has obvious ties to Oregon through company co-founder and alum Phil Knight, is in the running, as are Puma and Under Armour. Ionescu has been training in the San Francisco Bay Area with Golden State's Steph Curry, Under Armour's most prominent athlete. At a safe distance, of course.\"I would probably be in meetings with a lot of them, being able to meet a lot of the team and see how everything's done.

Whether it's a player like Diana Taurasi or Sue Bird, that's the thing that can separate the great ones and she has proven that she has that and thrives in those moments and loves it and loves basketball,\" Lobo said.Oregon teammates Satou Sabally and Ruthy Hebard could also be top 10 picks.The Ducks finished 31-2 this season, which ended prematurely with the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament because of the pandemic. They were ranked No. 2 in the final AP Top 25.Although Ionescu returned for her senior year in hopes of winning a national title, she said she has no regrets.\"I would say it was probably one of the best decisions of my life to come back, although there was many ups and downs through the year,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else besides there.\"", "tags": ["wnba", "sports", "ncaabk", "ncaa", "oregon-ducks"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 05:04:53", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 05:04:56"}

The post was later taken down.\"Good news for Trump supporters is that most of them already have masks.\"Kirby blamed Trump for his frustration, explaining that as a doctor he now puts his life on the line because of a lack of proper gear and testing capabilities.\"This president has put us all at risk,\" Kirby said.The council also heard voicemails about Kirby left by city residents and fellow council members, reported.\"These comments are hateful, degrading, bigoted and more consistent with the mentality of a 15-year-old,\" one voicemail said.\"These comments are hateful, degrading, bigoted and more consistent with the mentality of a 15-year-old.\"\"It is extremely disappointing and I believe that he should be removed,\" another message said.Others supported the mayor.\"I just wanted to call in support of Dr. Kirby,\" another voicemail said. \"I completely, 100 percent, agree with his assessment of the president.\" \"And this is how I feel: I abhor the things that he has said and done and I did not hear an apology from him tonight,\" City Councilwoman Cheryl Maki said.\"We need to be focused right now and our staff needs to be focused on the response to COVID and the recovery of COVID,\" said Councilman Daniel Berlant.Kirby said he will step down at the next council meeting on April 27, .", "tags": ["california", "politics", "local", "coronavirus", "health", "donald-trump", "us"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 01:41:52", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 05:03:11"}

This, however, has led to a trend of young adults temporarily moving back in with their parents, either to escape an area with a lot of infections or to ride out the outbreak in a larger house.Judy Holland, author of \"HappiNest: Finding Fulfillment When Your Kids Leave Home,\" spoke with Fox News about how parents can handle children returning home after quarantine, whether they're college students whose classes ended early or grown-ups escaping COVID-19.She recommended that parents take time to remind their kids that this is just a temporary pause in their lives, as returning home to mom and dad's house can sometimes feel like a step backward. But, as Holland says, this can actually be a good time to focus on self-improvement.\"Remind your boomeranged young adults that this is time-out! A time to improve themselves and their prospects. Fill in the holes,\" she said. \"Should they add a Ted Talk to their day? Reserve 20 minutes to read something interesting?\"To that end, Holland says it might be a good idea to rearrange the existing space to give your young adults a chance to get some of this work done, \"especially if you have college kids who need to learn online.\"Once that's settled, Holland says it's a good idea to define ground rules, like who does the laundry, who cleans, and who preps meals.\"They need to take an equal adult share of responsibilities. Don't do everything for them.\" This might also be a good time to bring back the family dinner, which is a good way to create a connection and provide an opportunity to share information, she said.\"Hopefully, this crisis -- as tough as it is -- can bring out the best in us,\" Holland concluded. \"Savor this rare opportunity to be together.\"", "tags": ["america-together", "lifestyle", "parenting", "coronavirus"], "published_time": "2020-04-09 13:15:45", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 05:23:13"}

Yet many experts also contend that now is hardly the right time for the United States to yank its many millions.The U.S has been the WHO's largest funder since it was founded in 1948 and currently gives almost 10 times the amount of money as China, both in assessed and voluntary contributions and which total more than $500 million per year compared to Beijing's $48 million.Brett Schaefer, senior research fellow in international regulatory affairs at the Heritage Foundation, also underscored that the U.S.' total contributions account for 15.9 percent of the organization's overall budget and the impact would not be immediately crushing.\"This funding would be unaffected because the decision to pull funding would only apply going forward. Nonetheless, suspending funding immediately would represent a big cut to WHO funds right when developing countries, which depend far more on international assistance to address health issues, are being impacted by COVID-19,\" he explained. \"Although the U.S. is providing significant assistance through other channels, withholding funding to WHO could negatively impact the COVID-19 response in these countries.\"But even with all the money voluntarily poured in from the U.S., the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other countries and organizations such as South Korea, Australia, and Japan, there have been murmurs in the sustainable health world that even that is not enough. Many analysts have highlighted that without the U.S., other member states - all of who are battling to contain the crippling virus within their own borders - likely would not be able to step up and fill the financial void anytime soon. Instead, the burden could fall on private donors such as the Gates Foundation, the Gavi Alliance and even the U.N.'s own Emergency Response Fund.A November 2018 report published by BioMed Central underscored that the WHO \"continues to experience immense financial stress,\" and that has consistently illuminated that it is \"underfunded,\" although its need for financial reform was paramount.\"The WHO must establish its presence as a trustworthy leader in the global health space,\" the report stated, acknowledging that member states had declined to dish out more money,\" for reasons including \"a lack of political will and financial commitment of member states especially by the rich donor countries as they found inefficiency, lack of transparency, and minimal accountability within the organization.\"The report also that the organization has struggled to carry out its mandate as a result of the United States, which \"has repeatedly opposed WHO taking any action which might run counter to the interests of transnational corporations,\" and has created a \"conflict of interest\" framework with such maneuvers as opposing the Code on the Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, WHO's rational use of medicines initiative, and its ethical criteria for drug marketing to ensure that pharmaceutical companies can profit.According to the WHO's own admission, internal audits are conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and are \"designed to add value and improve the Organization's operations and to enhance the integrity and reputation of the Organization. All systems, processes, operations, functions, and activities of the Organization can be subject to IOS review and oversight.\"The most recent , issued in May last year, ranked majority of programs and regional offices - from Ethiopia, Somalia, Chad, Myanmar, Afghanistan and the global malaria headquarters as being \"partially satisfactory.\"Several, such as offices in Yemen and Mongolia and deemed \"unsatisfactory,\" and Ukraine was stamped with a rare \"satisfactory.\" Moreover, the U.N. agency - as revealed in internal rather than published reports obtained by the last year - found that in 2018 they spent more on travel expenses - occasionally unauthorized and exploitive on donors' dimes - than on fight some of the biggest problems in public health.In a single year, the \"cash-strapped\" WHO is alleged to have forked out almost $200 million on jet-setting, with staffers sometimes breaking the agency's own rules by traveling in business class, booking expensive last-minute tickets, staying in five-star hotels and traveling without approval.By contrast, that same year, the WHO invested $59 million in curbing tuberculosis and around $71 million AIDS and hepatitis.\"WHO solicits money from countries around the world every year and rarely if ever meets its budget,\" lamented Curtis Ellis, an economic expert and policy director with America First Policies and former advisor to the Trump 2016 election campaign. \"If the U.S. withheld its money, it would have to recalibrate its actions, and stop its officials from flying business class.\"The U.S. government typically advises officials not to fly business class, but provisions are made under certain circumstances such as disabilities or upgrades at their own expense.Nonetheless, the WHO to spend most of its money on communicable diseases, followed by corporate services and enabling functions, health emergencies, health systems, promoting health through the life course, non-communicable diseases; and an array of other areas such as polio eradication, tropical disease research, and research in human reproduction.Of the total $6.27 billion in WHO financing, only $554 million - about 9 percent - went to the WHO Health Emergency Program and another $306 million to preventing and controlling outbreaks under the \"Humanitarian Response Plans and Other Appeals\" budget category.\"In other words, it appears that less than 15 percent of WHO financing in 2018-2019 was directed at detecting and combatting international pandemics. More funds went to Corporate Services and Enabling Functions that to the WHO Health Emergency Program,\" Schafer noted.Other health issues that the WHO dedicates resources to include: equity, social determinants, gender equality, and human rights ($21.5 million); reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health ($230 million); violence and injuries, such as those from road accidents, ($27.5 million); and mental health and substance abuse ($50.3 million).\"While these are legitimate health concerns, unlike communicable diseases and pandemics, they are primarily a domestic health matter and do not pose a threat to spread from one country to another,\" Schafer said. \"The focus of WHO should be on truly international threats to health.\"From his lens, instead of ending funding during the current crisis, the U.S. should condition future financing for the approval and completion of an investigation into the WHO response to COVID-19 and the potential influence of China over its decisions, revision of WHO policies to enable it to respond more quickly to emerging pandemics and restructuring WHO financing to concentrate on communicable diseases and responding to international health emergencies.\"If WHO refuses, the U.S. should explore setting up a new international organization focused on communicable diseases and responding to international health emergencies,\" Schafer said.According to Brett Bruen, a former U.S. diplomat who previously served as director of global engagement at the White House and now runs communications firm Global Situation Room, freezing the finances now is akin to \"suggesting we pull out of NATO in the middle of the battle against the Taliban.\"\"Sure, we would like them to do more and can get frustrated with multilateral diplomacy. But, they are critical to our fight, and WHO is essential to turning the tide against COVID-19. There is no path out of this epidemic on our own. We need other countries,\" he stressed. \"There is no substitute for the WHO.

Commissioned by the University of Phoenix, the survey found Americans have a wide variety of concerns at the current moment, with health -- mental and physical -- first on the list. Results revealed respondents' top concern to be their loved one's health (71 percent), followed by their own (61 percent).Other respondents were worried about experiencing increased anxiety (41 percent) and not being able to pay bills (33 percent) as a result of the pandemic. Three in 10 were concerned about missing out on celebrating milestones, while 27 percent were worried about feeling prolonged loneliness or depression.With so much unpredictability, 68 percent said they feel like everything is out of their control -- and 53 percent of respondents wish they had tips on how to better take care of their mental health during this time.But the survey, conducted by the Harris Poll, found some respondents are taking steps in the right direction to maintain or improve their mental health: Six in 10 have checked in with a loved one, while 35 percent are exercising more. Three in 10 recognize the importance of self-care while staying informed, and are therefore limiting their news consumption. Other steps respondents are taking for their mental health include planning for a post-pandemic future (30 percent) and performing acts of kindness for others (29 percent).\"While many people only associate negative feelings with social distancing, there can be several benefits embedded in such opportunities,\" said Dr. Dean Aslinia, counseling department chair, University of Phoenix. \"Reach out to an old friend, but instead of texting or emailing, make a phone call or use video chat to build a more meaningful connection. Build activity in your day by trying something new or setting a small goal for yourself. Start a new fun project or challenge that you can share with friends or loved ones. Engaging in activities and interacting with people that uplift you is important for maintaining mental health in uncertain times.\"But not only is mental health important right now, so is physical health. In more good news, 59 percent of respondents report \"always\" following the social distancing guidelines, while 31 percent are following them most of the time.Almost half (47 percent) of those surveyed believe social distancing guidelines will continue to be in place between two to three months while 27 percent believe it'll be four months or longer.\"Feelings of loneliness are not solely due to isolation or social distancing,\" said Dr. Aslinia. \"Some of the challenge is that our connections are not emotionally fulfilling and are increasingly less personal, genuine, and may be void of real empathy. Technology overuse, impersonal interactions and choosing to interact with people that are not healthy for us all lead to loneliness.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.After weeks of holding out hope that the Tour de France would be able to go ahead as planned, the world's most famous cycling race was finally added to the list of sporting events postponed by the coronavirus pandemic.The three-week race could still take place this year, however, with French newspapers reporting late Tuesday that a new start date has been set for August. Both L'Equipe and Le Parisien said organizers are now hoping to stage the race from Aug. 29-Sept. 20.That new time slot would see the race end on Champs-Elysees just as the rescheduled French Open tennis tournament starts a few miles away in western Paris.Tour organizer Amaury Sport Organisation did not immediately reply to a request for confirmation from The Associated Press. But local authorities in Haute-Savoie region tweeted that the last of the mountain stages will pass through its rugged and daunting climbs on Sept. 17 on the race's 18th stage.The Tour was set to start on June 27 in the Riviera city of Nice. But that effectively became impossible on Monday night when French President Emmanuel Macron announced in his speech to the nation that all public events with large crowds have been canceled until at least mid-July.\"Given that it's now impossible that the Tour starts at its planned date, we are consulting with the (International Cycling Union) to try and find new dates,\" ASO had said earlier Tuesday.The last time the Tour was not held was in 1946, with the nation still emerging from World War II. It was also stopped during WWI.Holding the race without legions of fans on the roadsides and mountain passes of France -- an idea previously proposed by French Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu -- is not something organizers are likely to favor.Millions of fans watch each year's race in a festive atmosphere across many regions. This year's event has 21 stages, with the longest of them stretching 218 kilometers (135 miles). Thousands of police officers are needed to keep crowds under control and help negotiate safe passage for riders.Riders, too, have to be physically ready to tackle the grueling race -- and able to actually attend it. After weeks of confinement, competitors would likely need several more weeks to get into racing shape.Borders would have to be open, too, so racers like last year's winner -- Colombian rider Egan Bernal -- can travel to France.Juggling the cycling calendar is also tricky because of the various races scheduled throughout the season, including the Giro d'Italia and the Spanish Vuelta.The Giro, which had been set for May, was called off late last month.The Spanish race, which is also owned by ASO, is still on the schedule for Aug. 14-Sept. 6 but could feasibly be moved forward by a week or two so as not to clash with the Tour.", "tags": ["france", "sports"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 04:56:51", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 04:56:55"}

Pritchard makes the 30-minute drive to check on the Cup and the Hall's other trophies twice a week and make sure all is well at a quiet time usually filled with the buzz of playoff games.\"The Stanley Cup is put away, the NHL trophies -- everything is locked up and everything,\" Pritchard said. \"Everything's safe and sound.\"No one knows when it will be safe for the most storied trophy in sports to be in the public eye again. Upon March 12, Commissioner Gary Bettman said the NHL's \"goal is to resume play as soon as it is appropriate and prudent so that we will be able to complete the season and award the Stanley Cup.\"That particular moment is the culmination of each season and a long journey for the Cup under the watchful eye of Pritchard, Mike Bolt, Howie Borrow and its other handlers. One of its final stops this season came in Salmon Arm, British Columbia, before the final few across Canada were canceled.This time of year is typically among the busiest for the 128-year-old trophy. A year ago, it went from President Donald Trump's Oval Office desk during the to a concert stage in Tampa, Florida, to mark the opening night of the playoffs and on to appearances on the \"Today\" show set in New York and the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.Not this year. With distancing regulations in effect, Pritchard and his colleagues are mostly cataloging items from home. He said the Hall of Fame hasn't yet begun gathering items from the most recent games but acknowledged they might become part of the \"Year in Review\" display if the season doesn't resume.\"If hockey doesn't continue this year at any level, it's going to be a different display,\" Pritchard said. \"We're always trying to preserve some part of hockey.

Seattle's pending addition to the NHL in 2021 and the 100-year anniversary of the year without a Cup champion made him think about it, but he is more concerned about current events.\"The focus for me and everyone else right now is to make sure our family and friends are OK and see what happens from there,\" Pritchard said.Of course, if the NHL can get back and crown a new champion, Pritchard will be there.\"I'll have my white gloves on,\" he said.", "tags": ["nhl", "sports"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 05:00:36", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 05:00:41"}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Lying comes naturally to the Chinese Communist government, which will say anything to maintain its tight on the reins of power.Officials in Beijing continue to lie about the number of deaths in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus. The official toll is 2,500, but some 5,000 burial urns were delivered to just one Wuhan crematorium, and pictures of overwhelmed Wuhan hospitals circulated widely. Radio Free Asia, which has excellent sources within China, says that as many as 42,000 people could have died in the city.But the dishonesty didn't start with the novel coronavirus. The government has been lying for 31 years about the Tiananmen Square massacre of several thousand freedom-seeking students in June 1989. Beijing insists that only a few people died and that troops were merely to quiet so-called \"hooligans\" and maintain public safety.The Chinese Communist government lies about its persecution of the Muslim Uighurs in western China. An estimated 1 million Uighurs -- one-tenth of the population -- have been placed in so-called \"education centers.\" We don't know how many have died in these gulag-like camps circled with barbed wire while being educated in Chinese President Xi Jinping's school of thought. Nor do we know how many Uighurs have died of COVID-19 disease.The Chinese Communist government lied that it intended to honor its 1984 agreement with the British regarding the transfer of authority of Hong Kong to China. Ever since, like some giant boa constrictor, Beijing -- enabled by an excessively deferential Hong Kong government -- has steadily encroached on the political affairs of the city's 7 million inhabitants.The greatest lie of all was the monstrous suggestion made by a Chinese Foreign Ministry official that the coronavirus might be American in origin -- that it was brought to Wuhan by the U.S. military. Such calculated disinformation was the stock in trade of the Soviet Union, whose casebook Communist China has clearly copied.Another book the Chinese Communists have obviously read is \"1984.\" In George Orwell's classic novel, truth is what the government says it is, and anyone who challenges the \"truth\" pays a high price. That includes, in particular, the closely monitored social media. As one editor put it, \"The truth is that the Chinese Communist Party leadership regards any reporting of the facts as ultimately a threat to the stability of the regime\" -- and to the authority of the 90 million members of the CPP.When I visited Communist China a decade and a half ago and lectured at major universities in Beijing and Shanghai, I was usually asked how the United States and China could improve their relations. I always replied that enduring relationships had to be built on a foundation of truth, and until Beijing was willing to tell the whole truth about the Tiananmen Square massacre -- as well as the human price of disastrous Maoist experiments like the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward -- there could be no meaningful relationship. The invariable response was a frozen silence.Today, we are still waiting for the lies to end and the truth to be told about life and death in a country that one Chinese friend of mine calls \"the land of the lie.\"", "tags": ["china", "opinion", "coronavirus", "infectdis", "health"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 14:56:17", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 05:00:05"}

J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, is concerned that federal authorities may seize the items for a stockpile that would serve all 50 states, the Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.News of the potential deal emerged on the same day that President Trump announced the U.S. will halt funding to the over \"China-centric\" policies such as opposing Trump's China travel ban, which the president credits with slowing the arrival of the coronavirus to the U.S.Illinois recently spent $174 million on purchases related to the virus, including masks, gloves, gowns, eyewear and hand sanitizer, the Sun-Times report said.The list also included two invoices for $888,275 each, to FedEx Trade Networks Transport for charter flights to Shanghai, but the governor's press secretary would not provide details about the flights, .\"The Governor has clearly outlined the challenges this administration has faced as we've worked around the clock to purchase PPE [personal protective equipment] for our healthcare workers and first responders,\" Jordan Abudayyeh, the press secretary, wrote in a statement.\"The supply chain has been likened to the Wild West, and once you have purchased supplies, ensuring they get to the state is another herculean feat. These flights are carrying millions of masks and gloves our workers need. They're scheduled to land in Illinois in the coming weeks and the state is working to ensure these much needed supplies are protected and ready for distribution around the state.\"President Trump has previously said that individual states were in charge of procuring medical gear for themselves, with the federal government \"here to help them\" if needed.\"They have to get that gear themselves,\" Trump told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on March 24. \"If they don't have -- like with [New York] Governor [Andrew] Cuomo -- he had a chance to order 16,000 ventilators ... two years ago and he turned it down -- now he can't be blaming us, but we're here to help them.\"Pritzker, like other Democrats, has been a harsh critic of Trump, earlier this month that \"the failures of the White House, of the president, have visited greater illness and greater number of deaths across the country.\"Meanwhile on Tuesday, Pritzker said at a news conference that Illinois was \"bending the curve\" in its fight against the virus, explaining that it was starting to take longer for the state to double its number of confirmed cases, according to .\"To be clear, there is nothing good about twice as many people having this virus, or worse, dying from it, no matter how long the increase takes,\" Pritzker said. \"But we won't get to zero cases overnight.

The disease has now swept across the world with a horrific death toll and is keeping millions of us in our homes to halt its spread.Someone has to ask why the World Health Organization - filled with health experts and backed by 194 member states and a U.N. charter - failed to sound a loud alarm on the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hit back fast at President Trump Tuesday night.\"It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against COVID-19,\" Guterres said. The UN is OK with looking at lessons learned when the pandemic is over, but \"now is not that time,\" he said.Honestly, if not now, when?There are now about 2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world and over 126,000 deaths. That includes nearly 610,000 confirmed cases in the U.S. and nearly 26,000 deaths. And due to a lack of testing and underreporting by China, the real numbers are certainly higher.Asking questions about what's going on at the WHO can no longer be avoided.As is now appallingly clear, the WHO is a health care bureaucracy, not a crisis response outfit. Chartered by the United Nations, the WHO has a headquarters in Geneva and 7,000 staff members working in 154 countries.Since 2011, the WHO'S main objective has been reform. Health is a fundamental human right, it says.The organization's reform priorities are just what you'd expect: advancing universal health coverage, non-communicable diseases, mental health, international regulations, increasing access to affordable medical products and \"reducing health inequities by addressing the social, economic and environmental determinants of health.\"I doubt President Trump will permanently rescind all U.S. funding for the WHO. Still, he is absolutely right to lead the charge for a prompt investigation of the WHO bungling in dealing with the coronavirus and how to fix it.What really sticks out is that from the beginning, the WHO appeared satisfied to take China's data on the spread of the coronavirus at face value, even though China has a reputation for falsifying statistics on everything from air pollution to military spending. On Jan. 14 the WHO tweeted: \"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.\" What a wrong statement that turned out to be!Weeks later, a joint WHO-China mission toured Chinese coronavirus hotspots from Feb. 16-24. Of the 25 experts, 14 were Chinese and two were Russian. Only two Americans, both very prominent, were on the panel.The final report had some good data, but the overall tone downplayed the impact of the new virus. For example, the report asserted human-to-human transmission in China was happening mainly inside families.Other two-and-a-half weeks passed before the WHO declared the coronavirus was a global pandemic March 11.By then, Italy was in crisis, the virus was taking aim at New York City, and the first wave of closures began. You know the rest.The WHO experts had a golden opportunity in January and February to swing into action, learn more about the Wuhan outbreak, and start coming up with good global advice.The world was counting on the WHO - but that organization just wasn't giving good guidance fast enough. \"The WHO really blew it,\" Trump tweeted April 7.Here are four things President Trump's team needs to consider before U.S. dollars again flow freely to the WHO:Reading the crucial Feb. 24 report from the joint WHO-China team, it's impossible to miss the pro-China rhetoric.\"In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history,\" concluded the report. The same report stated that \"General Secretary Xi Jinping personally directed and deployed the prevention and control work\" of the COVID-19 outbreak.Seriously? That reads like an article from the Chinese Communist-controlled People's Daily newspaper.The world needs a reliable, committed WHO that can handle crisis response. The WHO took months to declare an emergency during the 2014 Ebola epidemic, British health expert Charles Clift told The Atlantic Monday. An internal look is overdue.Americans have long put up with snarky, politicized rhetoric from U.N. officials. But if the global pandemic goes on, the WHO needs leadership with stature.Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., has called on WHO head Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus to resign. Tedros, who was Ethiopia's minister of health, is the first non-medical doctor to head the WHO. He has a Ph.D. in community health and was widely reported to be China's choice when he took over in 2017.President Trump got some NATO allies to spend more on defense. There's no reason the U.S. should be contributing such a disproportionate share of funding to the dysfunctional WHO. Trump has a stakeholder's responsibility to set it right if he can.The bottom line is that President Trump has every right to demand accountability from the WHO for its disastrous handling of the coronavirus outbreak that turned into a pandemic. America can't simply serve as the WHO'S ATM no matter how awful the organization's performance.", "tags": ["world", "opinion", "china", "health", "infectdis", "coronavirus", "donald-trump"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 03:45:36", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 04:36:24"}

{"url": ["https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-targets-new-enemies-who-governors-and-old-ones-the-media"], "title": "Trump targets new enemies (WHO, governors) and old ones (the media)", "content": "The WHO failed its basic duty and must be held accountable, says President Trump.Just as his battle with the media is reaching new heights, President Trump is finding new enemies in the war on the coronavirus--and who is to blame for the pandemic.That was on display yesterday when Trump halted U.S. funding to the World Health Organization, accusing the group of \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,\" in part by having \"pushed China's misinformation.\" Trump, of course, had once praised China's early efforts.He also drew fresh battle lines with the nation's governors, saying they need to take a back seat right now.In the blink of a news cycle, the president is being accused of acting like a \"king,\" of trashing the Constitution, of using a White House briefing to air \"propaganda.\"Putting aside the rhetoric, what's clear to me is that Trump wants credit for reopening the economy, which would obviously be good news, while he was happy to let the governors shoulder the burden of shutting down the economy, which was painful news. That's hardly an unusual stance for politicians -- who prefer to announce new spending goodies but not controversial budget cuts -- but the life-and-death nature of the pandemic casts it in a much harsher light.Still, there was something about Trump's marathon presser on Monday that has everyone up in arms.Let's start with the president, responding to sharp criticism from Andrew Cuomo. He tweeted that \"Cuomo's been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state's responsibility...I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want independence! That won't happen!\"And addressing the nation's governors, Trump invoked the film \"Mutiny on the Bounty\": \"A good old-fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain! Too easy!\"What triggered all this were these presidential pronouncements about the governors: \"The president of the United States calls the shots. They can't do anything without the approval of the president of the United States.\"When asked what provision of the Constitution gave him this power, Trump said \"numerous provisions...When somebody's the president of the United States, the authority is total.\"New York's governor, who had been cooperating with the White House, went off in a series of TV interviews.\"It makes no sense, it's schizophrenic,\" Cuomo told CNN's \"New Day.\"It was \"a breaking of the Constitution,\" he told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" And: \"It's frightening. This is the last place we should be, this crazy politics, this absurd positioning when we're talking about life and death.\"Trump, as I've noted before, is all about projecting strength. If he declares that he has the supreme power, he knows full well that pundits and legal scholars will be arguing over the niceties of separation of powers while his base cheers him on. The same dynamic is at work while experts and diplomatic debate his freezing of aid to the WHO.While Republicans usually champion states' rights over the big, out-of-control national government, Trump has never particularly cared about federalism either.Has Trump conveniently said the feds are not a \"shipping clerk\" when he wanted the states to take the lead in getting testing kits and ventilators? Sure. But the president now says he could have chosen to nationalize the initial response to the coronavirus, but chose not to.It was Cuomo, Gavin Newsom, J.B. Pritzker and the rest, along with some mayors, who chose to close the schools, shut down non-essential business and issue stay-at-home orders. But that was then, as Trump sees it, and he wants to be the one heralding the economic comeback, even as both sides argue about the timing.Oh, and the press is also in the line of fire. \"For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states...,\" Trump tweeted.The president got into it Monday with CBS's Paula Reid, who pressed him on what he did with the breathing room afforded by his early restrictions on China travel. \"You didn't use it to prepare hospitals, you didn't use it to ramp up testing,\" she lectured him. The president interrupted, calling her \"disgraceful.\"Reid kept on talking as Trump tried to move on: \"What did you do with the time that you bought, the month of February?...What did your administration do in February with the time that your travel ban bought you?\"The president also drew fire for unveiling a campaign-style video that depicted him as acting (mainly against China) while the networks were interviewing guests who downplayed the coronavirus threat (true in part, as shown in selective clips.)One of the clips was of podcast comments by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who was heard saying that Trump was accused of \"xenophobia\" for halting flights from China and \"at the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus.\"Haberman called that \"misleading,\" saying on Twitter that her next comment -- that Trump treated the travel limits as a Mission Accomplished moment -- was cut out.If Trump and some governors do wind up issuing conflicting orders, it will put many businesses and institutions in a difficult position. But I don't see that happening.

We will all likely pay a heavy price.In an event not seen in any of our lifetimes, a virus has caused our booming to come to a screeching halt.Whether you agree with President Trump's response or not, the reality is that the federal government is the only entity that can simply print more money - states, counties, cities, towns and other local governmental units cannot.The failure of state and local governments to act in the best interest of the taxpayers by addressing the economic challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic now - rather than waiting until later - is going to reverberate throughout our country for the foreseeable future.Governments reliant on sales tax revenues are going to be devastated, since millions of us are staying at home and only venturing out buy food and other essentials. Governments relying on income taxes will also take a big hit, since unemployed workers have much lower taxable incomes. Property tax collections are likely to also drop, since some jobless workers will be unable to pay their taxes on time. I'm not aware of many state and local governments that have moved to curb their spending in the face of this crisis. I don't even hear them talking about the possibility of having to make spending cuts.State resources will be stressed to the maximum to deal with health care costs and big increases in unemployment caused by business shutdowns due to the pandemic. While the cost of helping the unemployed will have to increase, state and local governments are not doing much to make the tough decisions needed to cut expenses elsewhere to balance their budgets.State and local government pension funds will fall even further behind in their funding. For far too long, pension managers have snookered the public and retirees with wild projections on their returns from their investments. Some projected 7 percent annualized returns that were unrealistic even in good times.Now state and local government retirees who failed to convert to a defined contribution plan rather than a defined benefit plan will find themselves in a truly dire situation.When I served in the House of Representatives, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and I worked on this problem by trying to get the state and local governments to verify their current obligations compared to their ability to pay. We met with resistance at all levels.This is a multitrillion-dollar problem that will inevitably leave retirees with the cruel reality that they were lied to for decades and their promised retirement benefits are simply not there to be paid.Taxpayers should rightly be concerned that politicians who failed to plan and failed to save for a rainy day are now unlikely to make quick and tough decisions.Not many of us expect state and local governments to address these problems head-on by cutting spending. Instead, expect requests for federal bailouts and higher taxes. Both compound the challenge of restarting the economy and neither solves the underlying issue.Millions of taxpayers have been forced - through no fault of their own - to stop contributing to the economy. They shouldn't now be forced to prop up bloated state and local governments.Nobody wants to be in this situation, but unfortunately, it is the reality, and reality is the most difficult thing for politicians to deal with in real-time. It takes guts, making hard decisions, and speaking the truth that some things need to be sacrificed so we can prioritize what is most important.This has rarely happened in the past, but let's all hope it happens now. It's time for state and local government officials to show bold leadership when it comes to their own budgets. The citizens who elected them deserve no less.", "tags": ["health", "opinion", "infectdis", "coronavirus", "state", "economy", "taxes", "budgets"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 02:10:56", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 04:00:54"}

Chang: Trump right to stop funding World Health Organization over its botched coronavirus response", "content": "Asia analyst Gordon Chang speaks to Fox News about China's continued efforts to censor coronavirus information.President Trump was right to announce Tuesday that he will immediately stop funding the , which was scheduled to get $893 million from the U.S. in the current two-year funding period.The president's action is the first step needed to spark meaningful reform of the organization and the global health architecture.Trump last week signaled he was unhappy with the WHO. In an interview aired April 7 on \"Hannity\" on Fox News, Trump suggested the U.S. might stop contributing to the organization.By Tuesday, Trump had seen enough.\"So much death has been caused by their mistakes,\" Trump said of the WHO. He is absolutely correct. The WHO helped spread the coronavirus in four principal ways.First, in public the WHO disseminated China's false narrative that the virus was not transmissible person-to-person.The U.N. organization, however, knew or should have known the Chinese government was not telling the truth. Among other things, Taiwan on Dec. 31 the U.N. body it suspected the pathogen was contagious in this fashion - and WHO professionals also knew that to be the case.Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO doctor, at a press briefing on Monday that \"right from the start\" she thought the coronavirus was human-to-human transmissible, but senior WHO leadership disregarded the evidence of this.Second, the WHO in its public statements supported the Chinese government's attempt to prevent the imposition of travel bans and quarantines on travelers from China. It was these travelers who turned an epidemic in central China into a global pandemic.Third, the WHO publicly backed the reliability of Beijing's statistics. China's substantial undercounting of its coronavirus cases and deaths lulled the U.S. into not taking precautions it would otherwise have adopted.Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator, said March 31 that her team reviewed China's statistics and thought the coronavirus outbreak would be no worse than SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the 2002-03 epidemic that effected more than 8,000 people in 26 countries.It was not until Birx saw the coronavirus strike Italy and Spain that the White House realized the truth - the coronavirus was far more dangerous than the Chinese government claimed. But by then it was too late.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key Trump adviser in the coronavirus crisis has made comments similar to Birx. As of Tuesday, there were nearly 2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 - the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus - around the world, including nearly 610,000 in the U.S. There were over 126,000 deaths confirmed worldwide, including nearly 26,000 in the U.S. However, all these figures are understated because of Chinese underreporting and because few people around the world have been tested.Fourth, the WHO unreasonably the coronavirus epidemic a \"public health emergency of international concern\" until Jan. 30.The WHO, President Trump correctly said Tuesday, failed its \"basic duty and must be held accountable.\"There is no nation in a position to hold the WHO accountable other than the U.S., which gives the WHO far more money than does any other country.\"As the organization's leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability,\" Trump correctly said.Trump's withdrawal of funding does not mean the U.S. is abandoning the world during the middle of a pandemic.\"We will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms,\" Trump pledged. \"For the time being, we will redirect global health and directly work with others.\"Who are these others? The U.S. can work with Taiwan, which of all the countries in the world has had arguably the best response to the coronavirus pandemic.But Taiwan is the one country the World Health Organization - bowing to Beijing's demands - will not work with.This shunning of the island republic was something painfully evident from Dr. Bruce Aylward's . The senior adviser to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus refused to talk about Taiwan.Now, after Trump's announcement, the global community has the opportunity to work closely with a valuable partner.Of course, it's not certain Trump will be able to fashion a better response to the coronavirus pandemic in the middle of the emergency, but defunding the WHO was a precondition for doing so.Thanks to Trump taking the right step Tuesday, at least now there is hope.", "tags": ["world", "opinion", "china", "world-health-organization", "un", "health", "coronavirus", "infectdis", "donald-trump"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 22:59:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 16:44:56"}

The theory, however, has gained traction in recent days.Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday afternoon, \"It should be no surprise to you that we have taken a keen interest in that and we've had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that. I would just say at this point, it's inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural, but we don't know for certain.\"The United Kingdom that the idea that the virus, which has turned into a full-blown global pandemic, was leaked from a Wuhan lab is \"no longer being discounted.\"A member of the U.K. government's emergency committee of senior officials claimed Sunday: \"There is a credible alternative view (to the zoonotic theory) based on the nature of the virus.

The lab had already been receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch.The cable also called attention to the head of the research project, who in November 2017 published a paper that showed the horseshoe bats collected from a case in Yunnan province were most likely from the same bat population that had been behind the first SARS coronavirus in 2003.The cable states that \"the researchers also showed that various SARS-like coronaviruses can interact with ACE2, the human receptor identified for SARS-coronavirus. This finding strongly suggests that SARS-like coronaviruses from bats can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases. From a public health perspective, this makes the continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal-human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention.\"Despite evidence that points to dangerous practices inside the Wuhan labs, top U.S. military brass, as well as other senior officials, have told Fox News that the origins of COVID-19 did not come from a laboratory nor was it the result of a bioweapon.\"And if I could just be clear, there is nothing to that,\" Air Force Brig.

In both cases, he cited health concerns.Democrats had feared that low turnout in Wisconsin would hurt their chances, while they have a more optimistic outlook in Nevada. Writing on April 10 to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, Elias first took aim at , which prohibits ballot harvesting and permits only certain individuals, like family members, to return ballots. Ballot harvesting, or the practice of allowing political operatives and others to collect voters' ballots and turn them in en masse to polling stations, has drawn bipartisan concerns of fraud from .In his letter, Elias argued that \"many Nevada voters will not be able to return their mail-in ballots themselves and do not have family members - or are separated from these family members because of social distancing - who can do so for them.\"\"We ask that your office and the office of the Nevada Attorney General immediately announce a suspension of prosecutions under this statute for all elections for which mail-in balloting will be the primary means of voting in the state,\" Elias said.At the same time, Elias called for Nevada to stop throwing out ballots when signatures on voters' ballots appear different from those on voters' registrations, saying \"lay election officials have never had the necessary expertise\" to make an accurate determination. \"In an environment where the vast majority of Nevada voters will be casting a mail-in ballot for the first time, there is the real possibility that hundreds of thousands of Nevada voters could be disenfranchised due to the arbitrary determinations of these untrained officials,\" Elias wrote. In the alternative, Elias said that those found to have mismatched or missing signatures should be given an additional two weeks, instead of the normal one-week deadline, to clarify the matter.Elias also demanded that Nevada \"require mail-in ballots be sent to all registered voters in Nevada, not just those in an active status.\" Elias asserted that state election law doesn't distinguish between the two categories of voters.Republicans have argued that many states fail to adequately clean up their voter rolls. Last year, California was forced to after a court settlement last year when California's rolls showed a registration of 112 percent.Further, Elias urged that Nevada \"require more than just one in-person vote center per county in the State's most populous counties as well as those with geographically distant population centers.\"\"Nevada voters have a proud tradition of voting in person either during the early voting period or on election day,\" Elias wrote. \"Having only a single in-person location in each county poses certain risks and hardships to voters in various circumstances--voters in dense urban communities, for example, will be forced into dangerously overcrowded polling places, while rural voters will have to travel unreasonable distances just to cast their ballots.\"On April 6, though, Elias called it a \"national disgrace\" that \"may well cost lives\" when the Wisconsin Supreme Court blocked an order to shut down in-person voting there. \"No one should have to chose between voting and their health,\" Elias wrote on Twitter., is known for his role hiring private research firm Fusion GPS to probe Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign - efforts which resulted in the .Elias did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News, but Republicans argued that the letter exposed Democratic partisanship.\"Democrats' hypocrisy knows no bounds,\" Republican National Committee (RNC) Chief of Staff Richard Walters told Fox News. \"The same people who were fear mongering about in-person voting last week are suddenly demanding more opportunities for in-person voting.\"Elias did appear to be citing health concerns in both cases, however -- first by criticizing Wisconsin for having in-person voting at all, and later by arguing that limited polling locations In Nevada would force voters into overcrowded spaces.But Walters pointed to the ballot-harvesting request as part of a bigger scheme.Walters added: \"Democrats' entire strategy is to legalize ballot harvesting nationwide, and this letter proves it. Sending far-left activists door-to-door to collect ballots not only jeopardizes people's health, it threatens the security of their ballot. The last thing our country needs during a time of crisis is to weaken confidence in our elections, but that is exactly what would happen if Democrats get their way.\" In 2018, despite holding substantial leads on Election Day, many Republican candidates in California saw their advantage shrink, and then disappear, as late-arriving Democratic votes were counted in the weeks following the election. Many observers pointed to the Democrats' use of ballot harvesting as a key to their success in the elections.\"Anecdotally there was a lot of evidence that ballot harvesting was going on,\" Neal Kelley, the registrar for voters in Southern California's Orange County, told Fox News.In Orange County - once seen as a Republican stronghold in the state - every House seat went to a Democrat after an unprecedented \"250,000\" vote-by-mail drop-offs were counted, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\"People were carrying in stacks of 100 and 200 of them. We had had multiple people calling to ask if these people were allowed to do this,\" Kelley said.California had recently legalized ballot harvesting ahead of the election. In 2019, a GOP operative in North Carolina related to alleged ballot harvesting, which is prohibited in that state.\"GET RID OF BALLOT HARVESTING, IT IS RAMPANT WITH FRAUD,\" President Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. \"THE USA MUST HAVE VOTER I.D., THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN HONEST COUNT!\"", "tags": ["2020-presidential-election", "politics"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 11:53:06", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 21:05:53"}

It wasn't even on the radio. It was done over a teletype, which was a device used to send and receive typed messages over wires or radio waves.\"I was thinking that it was going to be a long day,\" Youngblood recalled. \"I knew there was going to be a lot of people drafted, and I didn't have any idea who they were because we didn't play outside the SEC when I was at Florida... I remember sitting there watching this thing happen on the teletype. I watched [Dan] Pastorini come off, I watched [Jim] Plunkett come off, and several others that turned out to be great players. And I'm sitting there thinking, 'I'm really bored.'\"And then it came across the teletype: \"Jack Youngblood. Defensive lineman. University of Florida. Los Angeles Rams.\" This year, the coronavirus pandemic has had its say in how the NFL Draft will proceed.Originally scheduled to be in Las Vegas, the draft will now take place at ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Conn., and ESPN and the NFL Network will join forces and over all three days starting April 23.The grand spectacle of the draft, which is right behind the Super Bowl as the second biggest event in the sport, will have to scale back its live presentation that fans have grown so accustomed to, but Youngblood sees a silver lining with the \"virtual format\" of the draft this year.He believes that players from this draft class will play with a chip on their shoulders.\"It's going to take away from the excitement of it for these kids. That's for sure,\" Youngblood said. \"I don't know how that's going to pan out for them in the long run, but maybe it will make them work harder because they are not being run around, and acted like they are the next best thing since sliced bread. I don't know the results of this, but it will be interesting to see how they do when they get to training camp, and how they start that first year.\" Youngblood, who played his entire 14-year career with the Rams during the '70s and '80s, was a first-team All-Pro selection five times, and is one of only five players from the 1971 draft class to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Youngblood was famously known for playing the entire 1979 playoffs -- including the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl -- , and he credits former teammates Deacon Jones and Merlin Olsen for his growth as a football player.For NFL prospects like Ohio State defensive end Chase Young and LSU quarterback Joe Burrow, Youngblood suggests that players need to go into locker rooms and meeting rooms with their \"ears open.\"\"You have no clue to as what you're doing yet,\" Youngblood said. \"You need to listen and be coached. And let your older, veteran players guide you along. Just because you got drafted in the first round, and you're going to make $7 million this year, it doesn't mean you're a great football player.\"\"My purpose came from a blessing from my God,\" Youngblood continued. \"I firmly believe that He put me in that locker room with Deacon Jones and Merlin Olsen. Both of those guys, at one point or another in that first year, they put their arms around me and said, 'Kid, you can play, but you got to allow us to teach you to play,' and I said, 'Trust me, boys, yes sir. I'm all ears.' I had some big shoes to fill when Deacon got hurt in the sixth ball game of that 1971 season. That's a load in itself. And then when you realize I'm playing next to Merlin Olsen, and God helped me not to let him down.\"\"That's what teammates are about. They take care of each other, and that's how you be successful,\" he added. \"Both of those guys were a huge impact on my way of thinking and how I approach the game from the inside, and how I was going to try and perform.\"", "tags": ["nfl-draft", "sports", "nfl", "los-angeles-rams"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 19:46:26", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 04:42:03"}

At least 90 poultry houses were damaged or destroyed, many near the city of Collins, the Mississippi State University Extension Service said.\"Although some houses were between flocks and empty, many of these houses had chickens in them,\" poultry specialist Tom Tabler said in a statement. \"Some would have been chicks just a few days old, while others would have been flocks nearly ready for harvest.\"In , who toured damaged areas, said the pandemic was compounding a bad situation. \"The fact that the coronaviruses exist is complicating the recovery from the tornado, while the tornadoes are complicating our efforts to make sure that we do everything in our power to stop the spread of the virus,\" Reeves said during a stop in Soso. \"It is it is exceptionally complicated, and it's tough on all of us.\"About 40 miles away in Prentiss, around 15 people wearing masks helped clean up amid the rubble of James Hill Church, which took a direct hit from a tornado. A twister left shingles, insulation and other debris strewn across . Almost every official on a tour of storm damage wore a protective mask, and some wore gloves.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Scientists have developed an experimental vaccine for that, when delivered to mice using microneedles, caused antibody production against the disease within two weeks.Researchers had been working to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses, including the one that causes Middle East Respiratory System (MERS). They were able to adapt the system they'd been working on produce a candidate MERS vaccine to rapidly produce an experimental vaccine using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, according to the NIH Research Matters .The team, which includes scientists from the University of Pittsburgh, developed a method for delivering their MERS vaccine into mice using a microneedle patch.These patches look like a very small piece of velcro, but they contain hundreds of microneedles composed of sugar. The needles would prick the skin and dissolve, releasing the vaccine. The NIH notes that the immune system is highly active in the skin, so delivering vaccines this way could produce a more rapid and robust immune response than standard injections under the skin.When delivered by microneedle patch to mice, three different experimental MERS vaccines induced the production of antibodies against the virus. Antibody levels continued to increase over time in mice vaccinated by microneedle patch -- up to 55 weeks, when the experiments ended.Using knowledge gained from development of the MERS vaccine, the team made a similar microneedle vaccine targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine prompted robust antibody production in the mice within two weeks.The study, which was funded by the National Institute of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), and National Cancer Institute (NCI), appeared online on April 1, 2020, in , a Lancet journal.However, researchers cautioned that the vaccinated animals have not been tracked for long enough to determine if the long-term immune response is equivalent to what was observed with the MERS vaccine. Nor have the mice been challenged with SARS-CoV-2 infection.The components of the experimental vaccine could be made quickly and at large scale, according to the researchers, and the final product doesn't require refrigeration -- so it could be produced and put in storage until needed.The team now wants to obtain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to launch a phase 1 trial within the next several months.Still, much work needs to be done by scientists to explore the safety and efficacy of this candidate vaccine. \"Testing in patients would typically require at least a year and probably longer,\" said Dr. Louis Falo Jr. of the University of Pittsburgh in a statement to the NIH blog. \"This particular situation is different from anything we've ever seen, so we don't know how long the clinical development process will take.\"Scientists -- including NIH Director Dr. Anthony Fauci -- have said that developing an effective vaccine for COVID-19 would take about 12 to 18 months.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "science"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 19:27:43", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 20:00:38"}

He was a first-team All-Pro selection five times, and is only one of five players from the 1971 draft class to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Youngblood, who was famously known for playing the entire 1979 playoffs, including the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl, , told Fox News on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic has changed almost everything in his daily life.Youngblood went into more detail about his life in a Q&A with Fox News. We are here in Winter Park, Fla. And the most that it has done for me, it has slowed down my life. Usually, you hit the floor running and you have 16 different things to do. I've got stuff that I'm doing down here in Orlando, and I have a farm up in Jefferson County [Florida] that I've had all of my life. But now we can't handle all of that stuff at one time.It really pushed us backward. Not just me and my family, but this whole country. Everybody has got it back into first gear. They don't have the gas pedal to the floor anymore. That's the big thing that I see. And that's not America. That's not us. We are going to change this thing, and turn this thing around. And I firmly believe it's going to be phenomenal what we do when we finally get ahold of this invisible thing that is killing us. And stop it and kill it. And get it out of the way so we can continue on being the country that we are. I'm basically retired. I don't have a job. I have the farm up in Monticello, my old hometown. I have 200 acres up there, and it takes some time to take care of something like that.My wife Barbara, she has complicated lungs because of pneumonia. She had pneumonia three times in a row, within the course of a year and a half. I have to stay here with her just in case. I don't want her to be by herself. I'm about two and a half hours away from my farms. Every two weeks I'd run up there, spend 3-4 days up there and then turn around and come back. The lack of control. It's like somebody has a collar on you. And it has a short leash, and you have to obey. Those are the main things. It has changed how we live our lives. Every aspect of it. There's going to be new things that come into play. It's going to be similar to how we did things after 9/11. We changed a lot of things and a lot of ways with how we do business. It changed the way we traveled in this country. And I think this may be as bad, if not worse. The \"man hug\" will be out of the equation. That's not going to happen. You can still be polite. And people know and will understand, and accept the fact that you respect me, and I respect you. So, that's the reason we can't do some of the fundamentals that we used to do.They closed my gym down. That's like a stab in the heart. I'm a long-time player. I had a schedule every day of what I was going to do. And we trained and conditioned at 4 p.m. every day. And I've continued that until today in my life. I can't run anymore, but I can get out and walk. The exercise is one of the big issues with me in my daily routine.

The mother, whose name has been omitted for her privacy, reached out to the pro-life Loveline after learning about the service through in a Fox News .Now, she intends on not having an abortion, Loveline told Fox News.Pam Whitehead, who directs Loveline, corresponded with her and was able to help her apply for Medicaid as she faced difficulty in obtaining health care. Whitehead also connected the woman to an immigration attorney, who agreed to provide pro-bono services for her.The mother said she was fleeing domestic violence and came to the United States as an asylum-seeker from Italy.This example underscored how pro-life groups are trying to help women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple pro-life groups have told Fox News that pregnancy centers are working to accommodate women as governments implement a variety of restrictions. Whitehead also said her group saw her clients double during the crisis.Embrace Grace founder Amy Ford has continued throwing baby showers for pregnant women involved in her program -- just from a distance. Her group holds weeks-long programs for mothers with unexpected pregnancies and helps them connect to resources at local churches. Rather than in-person meetings, her groups are meeting virtually and sending baby shower packages to mothers' homes.Whitehead previously told Fox News that she was able to help a 12-year-old girl who said she was raped on her way home from school.\"She is the oldest of [six] children and her mother reached out to see if we could assist with baby items and rent during this COVID-19 scare,\" Whitehead said.\"Her baby was born two weeks ago at 26 weeks. We put out a registry of items she chose and the ProLife [sic] public filled the registry in about 40 minutes.\" According to Whitehead, her registries tend to fill within an hour.Whitehead added that the aid was being sent to an advocate who would unpack, sort and deliver the supplies to the family. \"We also paid their rent and sent a gas card so they can get to the NICU [Neonatal Intensive Care Unit] every day without worry,\" Whitehead said.Loveline is one of the projects of ProLove Ministries, a pro-life organization started by former Planned Parenthood director Abby Johnson. Johnson's other organization -- And Then There Were None -- focuses on providing support for ex-abortion clinic workers. At the end of March, the group reported it had provided nearly $150,000 in material and financial relief since starting in October 2019.Part of the group's activities include direct material relief through online registries and galvanizing the pro-life community. The group provides material goods such as diapers, wipes, formula, clothing and household needs. Within about six months of launching, Loveline reached $90,000 in material relief -- a marked increase from January when the group $22,000 in household and material goods.On Tuesday, Whitehead said her group has helped provide $62,000 in financial assistance, which includes rent, utilities, health care premiums, transportation, groceries and income replacement for women on maternity leave without pay.Loveline also regularly makes public appeals for donations online.

The deaths come while dozens of prisons grapple with a coronavirus rapidly spreading through overcrowded quarters and employee unions question ODRC leadership. To date, only 435 ODRC inmates have been tested, with 146 being positive for COVID-19. More than 16,000 prisoners across the state are under 12 prison-wide quarantines, according to ODRC data. 119 staff members have reported positive tests. The prison system has nearly 50,000 inmates, a number some advocates in Ohio say is 10,000 over capacity. The outbreaks have put employees and elected officials in a bind. Ohio has been a vanguard in coronavirus response under Gov. Mike DeWine's leadership. Still, critics said the prison system has been the state institution least buoyed by the Republican governor's decisive actions. For weeks, advocates and activists have called for him to release prisoners who have a low risk of recidivism and a high risk of severe coronavirus complications. This number would far outpace the roughly 200 prisoners whom DeWine has recommended for release.\"Locking down prisons, where there is no room to keep a safe distance from others, will not help save lives in prisons, and could actually make conditions worse given the fact that there are nearly 49,000 people in facilities designed for 38,000,\" said Piet van Lier, a researcher with the liberal think taznk Policy Matters Ohio. \"The total of 205 people the governor has recommended for release won't create the kind of conditions or flexibility needed to flatten the curve in prisons, which is what's needed to protect incarcerated people, prison workers and the broader community,\" he continued. The Ohio Organizing Collaborative, ACLU of Ohio, Juvenile Justice Coalition, Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP) and Faith in Public Life joined Policy Matters Ohio in a tele-press conference to call on Gov. DeWine to do more for incarcerated Ohioans.\"Right now, it seems like there's a lack of direction, a lack of leadership from the top down.\" Prisoners and prison workers alike have lamented the conditions that have caused the deadly virus to spread through a dozen institutions across the state. The head of the state's largest union of prison workers said the organization has purchased tens of thousands of N95 masks to supply its members. \"Right now, it seems like there's a lack of direction, a lack of leadership from the top down,\" said Christopher Mabe, a former corrections officers and now president of the Ohio Civil Services Employees Association. The union represents about 30,000 public employees in state and local governments across Ohio, including corrections officers and staff.He said the ODRC system is overtasked by a lack of staffing and a large amount of inmates, problems compounded by a lack of personal protective equipment and clusters of employees self-quarantining.\"We have several grievances at current time dealing with the director's implementation of policies,\" Mabe said. He said the union has been upended by unilateral decisions that have taken away the seat at the table for his members. He plans to file unfair labor practice grievances against the ODRC for what he says have been unilateral decisions by Director Annette Chambers-Smith.\"We've always in the past had a seat at the table,\" Mabe said. \"... We are professionals, we've been dealing with this for a long time.\"The ODRC confirmed that it has received formal grievances from the OCSEA. It also rebuffed claims by inmates that the prison system removed hand sanitizer from gathering areas.Requests for comment from Gov. DeWine's office went unanswered. Mabe's concerns are echoed by inmates and their loved ones. One prisoner, who will remain anonymous and spoke exclusively to Fox News, said his prison's quarantine has been rendered ineffective by a constant shuffling of inmates from one housing unit to another. The inmate said the population in his housing unit has risen by more than 20 and prisoners are sleeping on bunks less than three feet from one another. No bed is unoccupied, he said. \"People are on the brink of rioting. We've been on lockdown for about a week now, like around the clock lockdown.\"He ran down a litany of issues, from fewer meals and cramped quarters to rising tensions and inadequate medical treatment. Inmates used to be called for meals three times a day, but amid a prison-wide lockdown, that's decreased to just once for breakfast around noon and again for dinner around 9 p.m. The ODRC confirmed that meals have been reduced to just twice a day, but a spokesperson said the two meals are roughly a caloric equivalent of three meals.Another issue raised by inmates is the lack of COVID-19 testing, instead telling Fox News that medical personnel would deny testing unless the inmate exhibited every symptom of a severe coronavirus case.\"Incarcerated individuals who test positive to COVID-19 are placed in medical isolation and provided any necessary medical treatment,\" ODRC spokesperson JoEllen Smith told Fox News in an email. \"Speciality care and hospitalization services are provided at either local hospitals or the Ohio State University Medical Center.\"All testing is based on symptoms and based on the medical judgment of a physician or nurse practitioner,\" she continued.Inmates told Fox News they were hesitant of reporting COVID-19 symptoms to medical staff out of fears they'd be thrown into isolated quarters typically used for punishment.\"People are on the brink of rioting,\" the inmate said. \"We've been on lockdown for about a week now, like around the clock lockdown.\" Mabe confirmed that special response teams have been called over the past week. \"A couple of our institutions over the last week have had to call in our special response teams to defuse some situations,\" he said. Taken together, their red flags paint a picture of an overpopulated and understaffed system overrun by a deadly virus. Testing is woefully short of being enough to generate enough data to effectively mitigated the spread of COVID-19, and they say the same leadership that helped nonincarcerated Ohio avoid the worst of coronavirus has been sorely lacking in the prisons. \"It probably would've worked if they locked people down where they were. They've had us on lockdown but they've moving people.\"\"They were poorly prepared for this because they weren't taking it seriously,\" the inmate said. \"It probably would've worked if they locked people down where they were. They've had us on lockdown but they've moving people.\" The fiance of a second inmate at the same prison as the first inmate we spoke tosaid what distancing measures were in place, that inmates sleep head to toe in the bunks, weren't being enforced. She reinforced what both said about low staffing and rising tensions. \"The guards are definitely more on edge,\" she told Fox News. \"There's less staff because the guards are not coming in. They're home sick or quarantined or whatever. The ones who are there are visibly more on edge. They're handling it the best they can, but they're not really trained to do this sort of thing.\" The woman asked that her and her fiance's identity not be disclosed out of fear of retribution against him.\"Hopeless is a good word. Frustrated is another good word.\"The rapid spread of COVID-19 has upended life for everyone across the nation. Largely, the American people have been able to adapt. Inmates in Ohio, however, have been similarly upended but their ability to adapt has been allegedly hamstrung by ODRC leadership, and now the consequences have become deadly.\"Hopeless is a good word,\" the fiance of the Ohio inmate said. \"Frustrating is another good word. ... I really feel for any of the guys who get a positive diagnosis because I don't know how they're going to get any kind of sanitary care, let alone good treatment.

Klobuchar, a former Democratic presidential candidate, has been a leading voice in the Senate in raising the issue of the staggeringly high costs that phone carriers charge to prison inmates.\"Video-visiting, which is available to our female population, was also made free on that same date,\" Carvajal added. The bureau operates 122 facilities across the country.While the issue of the cost of phone calls has roiled inmates and prison reform activists for a long time, the issue has come to a head as prisons cut off in-person family and legal visits during the pandemic.Prisons and jails across the country have come under increasing scrutiny as reports come in almost daily of outbreaks of the virus in lock-ups. \"The handling of these situations vary, but ultimately we can say our system has been ill-equipped to deal with something of this magnitude and the prison system can no longer be society's afterthought,\" said Michael Mendoza, national director of #cut50, a campaign to reduce crime and incarceration levels in all states. \"With limited access to the proper resources, medical staff, and cleaning supplies, we fear prison systems could be hit the hardest by the virus. It is no wonder; the correctional staff refused to clean the area of the federal prisoners' area where he had previously been because they didn't have proper protective gear.\"The United States has some 2.3 million inmates in around 5,000 jails and prisons across the country, and is deemed to have the largest prison population in the world and the largest per capita incarceration rate. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, nearly 200,000 people age 55 and older are behind bars.Implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, such as routine hand-washing and social distancing, is especially challenging in such environments. Most inmates not only live in close proximity to one another but also share laundries, baths and communal eating areas. Hand sanitizer, given its high alcohol content, is also mostly prohibited.Besides phone calls, the virus has forced prisons and jails nationwide to start changing other longstanding policies and regulations. Arizona and Minnesota state prisons are now waiving the charges associated with medical visits and for medical supplies.Some 40 states mandate that inmates must pay for soap and other personal hygiene products, but some -- including Arizona -- have turned to issuing such items for free amid the outbreak.Additional safeguards have included facilities moving to ban visitors, limited inmates' movements and routinely screen staff for symptoms. Furthermore, at least 15 states -- including Texas, New York, California and Ohio -- have taken to releasing low-level offenders, as well as those in the elderly and sick categories and thus considered most vulnerable to being rendered in a critical condition if they contract the virus.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "politics", "amy-klobuchar", "local"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 16:51:27", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 17:13:52"}

I mean it. Blame me. Then get to thinking real hard how you're gonna get me to support your candidate the next time! Maybe even ask me, I'll tell you!\" Kulinski exclaimed. \"We shouldn't be defensive about this. If they're blaming us for Trump that's an admission that they need us to win. If they need us to win then they need to make concessions. Own it!\"That sparked a reaction from Intercept columnist Mehdi Hasan, who told Kulinski, \"If you're ok with a white nationalist winning a second term, I question your 'left-wing' credentials.\"Reid appeared to agree with Hasan and went even further with her criticism.\"What this kind of thing says to me is that these are not 'left-wing' voters. They are privileged white voters who demand to be bowed down to, no different than Trump's voters want those who are not white and Christian to take the knee for them like in the 'good old days,'\" Reid tweeted Monday evening. \"These are voters whose primary concern is that everyone else kneel. That's it. Kneel. Or they threaten the rest of us with the endless torment of Trumpism. Caged children. Viral death. Poverty. Want. Voter Suppression. Muslim bans. Of course none of this harms or impacts them.\"She continued, \"Well here is [reality]. No one is going to kneel. Those who get the danger of Trumpism are going to vote & find enough fellow voters committed to doing the right thing. The danger to living, breathing people is real. Most don't have the luxury to pout over their preferred candidate.\"Reid also acknowledged that \"yes of course there are nonwhite voters who fall into this category as well,\" noting that she met a black mother and daughter who voted for the Green Party in 2016 because of their dislike for Hillary Clinton.On Monday, Sanders' campaign national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray announced that she would not endorse the former vice president following the senator's own declaration.\"With the utmost respect for Bernie Sanders, who is an incredible human being & a genuine inspiration, I don't endorse Joe Biden,\" Gray wrote. \"I supported Bernie Sanders because he backed ideas like #MedicareForAll, canceling ALL student debt, & a wealth tax.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.A major chain is joining the push to get its workers classified as \"emergency personnel\" or \"extended first responders\" amid the coronavirus outbreak.Kroger, considered to be America's largest grocery store chain, issued a joint statement with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union to address the issue. The goal of the movement is to urge state and federal government officials to reclassify the workers as they face daily challenges due to the pandemic. In the statement, Kroger Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen and UFCW International President Marc Perrone describe how grocery store workers have been \"working tirelessly to make sure that millions of American families have the fresh food and products they need.\" In the statement, the two men say that the workers play a critical role in their communities and \"they must be protected.\"The statement continues: \"Given the significant daily risk these workers face, we are calling on all of our federal and state leaders to take immediate action. Specifically, we are requesting our nation's leaders to assign a temporary designation of first responder or emergency personnel status for all grocery workers. Make no mistake, this designation is absolutely critical as it will ensure these frontline workers have priority access to personal protection equipment like masks and gloves.\"Kroger isn't the only grocery chain working with the UFCW on this issue.Fox News recently reported that , another major chain in the United States, had also teamed up with the union to get workers reclassified.The UFCW also that 30 of its members have died from COVID-19.

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.The won't take place in June, after all, due to the pandemic, but organizers continue to explore different options for 2020.\"Following the French President's statement, on Monday, April 13th, we acknowledged that the postponement of the 73rd International Cannes Film Festival, initially considered for the end of June to the beginning of July, is no longer an option,\" the festival said on Tuesday. \"It is clearly difficult to assume that the Festival de Cannes could be held this year in its original form.\"\"Nevertheless, since yesterday evening we have started many discussions with professionals, in France and abroad,\" they added. \"They agree that the Festival de Cannes, an essential pillar for the film industry, must explore all contingencies allowing to support the year of Cinema by making Cannes 2020 real, in a way or another.\"Since announcing on March 19 that the 2020 edition would not be held in May, the festival was moving forward with a tentative plan to postpone the event until the end of June through the beginning of July.But the continued rise of casualties linked to COVID-19 in France and the rest of the world has made it impossible to move ahead with a summer event. France President Emmanuel Macron said in a televised interview on Monday evening that festivals would be banned in the country until mid-July. Festival director Thierry Fremaux, meanwhile, told Variety last week that turning the festival into a virtual event \"wouldn't work.\" One possible scenario would see Cannes being pushed to the fall. That timeframe, however, could be problematic because September is already packed with the Venice, Toronto and San Sebastian film festivals; while in October, Mipcom is already scheduled to take place in the city of Cannes for three days until Oct. 15. It would take about a month for the festival to be put together in the French Riviera town.Critics' Week and Directors' Fortnight, which run parallel to the festival, have yet to make announcements about their respective editions. The Cannes Film Market, expected to run alongside the festival as it always does, also has to decide whether it will take place this year as a digital event in mid-June/late July.Since its first edition after World War II in 1946, the Cannes Film Festival has only been canceled once in 1968 during the nationwide student riots, in which French New Wave icons Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard also took part. For the worldwide film community, the cancellation of the Cannes Festival would undoubtedly have a far-reaching impact, especially for sales agents and distributors for which the Cannes film market is the year's key event for dealmaking. Last year's film market reported a record 12,527 participants.Besides its importance to filmmakers, producers, distributors, and sales and talent agents, Cannes also plays a crucial role in positioning foreign-language movies commercially, as well as in the festival circuit and in major awards ceremonies, including Oscars, Golden Globes, BAFTAs, the European Film Awards, Spain's Goya Awards and France's Cesar Awards, among others. Last year, for instance, three of the five foreign-language films nominated in the international feature film category at the Oscars world premiered at Cannes. \"Parasite\" went on to win four Academy Awards and made history as the first foreign-language film to nab best picture.", "tags": ["cannes", "entertainment", "movies", "coronavirus"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 16:46:27", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 16:46:30"}

He met earlier today with a half-a-dozen COVID-19 survivors, many of whom said that they like the direction this is going in and will do anything they can to help the country, much like Bill's guests here, if it requires their plasma or anything else, anything to keep advancing the ball. And, by the way, that is one thing that has been happening, one of the reasons why, as Bill pointed out, Wall Street was up today, seeing some clarity on this, and maybe America getting back to work, if in stages or not. We're going to get the read from governors and the president. They have two different views on this, but they do seem to be on the same page eventually getting us all back to what was before, as if we can go back to what was before. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD. Let's go to Hillary Vaughn at the White House right now, because a busy day still in store for the president. We have that health care task force meeting. The president, I guess, at that, Hillary, will also outline this advisory board that will help him decide ultimately when and how much to reopen the government, right? HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's exactly right, Neil. And we're expecting that announcement in less than an hour, the details on who exactly is a part of this economic advisory council that will brainstorm the best way to get American businesses back open. We already know it will include administration officials, various governors, and also business leaders. And just this afternoon, we did get new details from the president himself dishing the information on what industries he's getting insight from. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm going to be making a decision pretty quickly. And it's being done in conjunction with governors, whether it's restaurants or whether it's airplane business or whether it's a lot of other things. We have a lot of businesses. And we have the best people in every -- every profession, including medical and including political. We want to have a sampling of everybody. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUGHN: In the meantime, governors around the country are getting to work, figuring out when to lift restrictions on businesses and stay-in-place orders in effect in their own states. An East Coast working group of governors from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, including public health officials and economic officials from each state, all of them are crafting an economic reopening plan for their region. And also a pact of West Coast governors from California, Washington and Oregon will also synch up a timeline to lift stay-in-place orders there. The president insists he has the power to override whatever these governors decide, Neil, but insists that, at this point, he is working with them to come up with a plan to reopen businesses and restart the economy. But just because the government may decide to lift restrictions on the national level, it doesn't mean the economy will reboot right away, Neil, because a new Gallup poll found that 71 percent of people say that even if the government does lift these restrictions, they're still going to wait to resume their life back to normal -- Neil. CAVUTO: Which could take a little while. All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very much. Again, 5:00 p.m., all that is ironed out or at least detailed. In the meantime, how will we decide to loosen things up in this country? Well, the CDC actually has a lot to say about that, in tracking the number of cases, the number of hospitalizations, all of that. Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta with the latest on that front. Hey, Jonathan. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Neil. Well, the nation as a whole appears to be reaching its apex in new cases, but the way that's panning out, it's unfolding differently in each individual state. I want to show you just one of the models. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, more than a third of U.S. states have already reached their peaks in hospital use. Over the next week, peaks are forecast for an additional nine states. They include California, which has managed to dramatically lower its projected hospital surge through intense social distancing and a strong public health response. The model shows an additional 14 states peaking between April 22 and the 30th. And in the first half of May, nine states are forecast to reach their peak hospital usage. To prepare for the surge, states are building temporary hospitals. Here in Atlanta, they're setting up a 200-bed unit at the Georgia World Congress Center, a major convention facility. The beds can be doubled to 400, if need be. But once states reach their peaks, wide-scale testing will be needed to isolate infected individuals and trace their contacts, so America can go back to a containment strategy, rather than mitigation, which is what we're doing right now. International health experts warn, reaching the top of the curve is not the end of our problems. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, DIRECTOR GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: The way down is much slower than the way up. That means control measures must be lifted slowly. (END VIDEO CLIP) SERRIE: President Trump says he wants to reopen the country as soon as possible, but we will base his decision the best advice from experts on health and the economy. And, right now, what public health officials are advising, don't do it all at once -- Neil. CAVUTO: All right, Jonathan, thank you very much, Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta. Now let's go out to William La Jeunesse in Los Angeles, how the West Coast now has to plan for this, because, as we said, this could be a rollout or at least an ease-out from these restrictions that go state by state, quite literally -- William. WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Neil, Both Governor Newsom of California and Governor Brown of Oregon said they fear right now that reopening soon will backfire. So we didn't get a date when the stay-at-home will end. But Newsom said, in the first week of May, if hospitalization and ICU rates not flatten, but decline, he will reveal a new timeline. He also said mass gatherings even late summer, MLB, NFL, college football, in his words, not going to happen. Each governor has their own benchmarks to guide decision-making. Governor Newsom said California needs to, number one, expand testing, tracing and tracking to identify new infections and suppress hot spots, so they don't bleed into other states or communities. Secondly, having the infrastructure to isolate and quarantine infected people, and finally protect vulnerable populations, elderly, homeless. Finally, the health care system needs to be robust, should the virus reemerge. Both governors say that their decision will be based on science, but recognize the economic balance. Governor Newsom: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): We are not out of the woods yet. And we are not spiking the ball. But we also extend a recognition in that light that this can't be a permanent state. (END VIDEO CLIP) LA JEUNESSE: Governor Kate Brown said Oregon is sharing best practices with California and Washington state. Her decision to open will be based on slowing the infection, securing adequate PPE for health care workers, doubling testing capacity, and hiring enough people for contact tracing, then isolate anyone who is positive anywhere in the state. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATE BROWN (D-OR): I think you will see a higher level of coordination and alignment in terms of how we take actions. But is our framework going to look the same as California's framework? Absolutely not. (END VIDEO CLIP) LA JEUNESSE: Now, Washington is likely to be the first state to lift its order. And Governor Inslee said he will not wait for California or Oregon. Newsom said this will not be a statewide order, but it'll allow different communities to act independently. But he also added you will probably see restaurants at half capacity, if you will, people still wearing their masks even when he does handle this order or at least mediate this order -- back to you. CAVUTO: Yes, it makes sense. They're not going to jump and run out of their homes, probably walk, maybe crawl, as they get used to this, whenever it happens. William, great job, as always, William La Jeunesse in Los Angeles. What are they going to look forward to justify a move to slowly unwind this so-called lockdown? We have with us right now Dr. Qanta Ahmed, a pulmonologist over at the Langone Medical Center in New York. Doctor, great to have you. What would you look for, Doctor, to sort of unwind this or justify unwinding this? DR. QANTA AHMED, PULMONOLOGIST: I mean, great to be with you, Neil. Everything that's been said makes common sense. But I think what we're talking about as a nation is that we had a hard stop, we came to a grinding halt abruptly, and now we're looking to softly restart the economy. That's what we have to do. And that is what we should do in a peri-pandemic, or, let's hope, soon a post-pandemic period. Remember, this pandemic that's arrived like a tsunami to New York isn't just going to be the only wave. Pandemics have a habit of coming in successive waves, localized outbreaks. And we now know how to handle them. We have learned a great deal in New York at NYU Langone. We are ready. We know how to treat them. We have the resources, and we can surge capacity. All of that is great. But at the same time, I also want to hear from business leaders on a global level. And I'm so thankful our president is a businessman. For instance, Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx, and how they resumed services in China. Today's Financial Times, the CEO of Volvo talked about how they have resumed work at Volvo in China and will be opening in South Carolina in May 6. So what they do is, every employee gets their temperature checked. Every employee has PPE. The cafeteria is now serving only a certain number of employees. All work forces in the U.S. are going to have to think about working around the clock, so that you can reduce office density by 60 percent. You have 30 percent of your work force working on three different shifts. We're going to have to make so many changes. And we can do it quickly. And we can reignite this economy. CAVUTO: I don't know what is more impressive, Doctor, that you're all over this whole pulmonology and medical stuff, but you would make a darn good financial anchor with those references to -- about business developments. Touche to you. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: As a pulmonologist, Doctor -- and you really look at respiratory tract, that sort of thing. They are -- those with problems in that area tend to be the most vulnerable or among the vulnerable. Would you recommend that that group, that subset of the population -- there are others, those with diabetes, et cetera -- who would not be in that first wave of workers returning? AHMED: Super question. And what you're referring to, I would absolutely support, because, in my critically ill patients, many of them have preexisting conditions that you're mentioning. But I think the number one risk factor the United States is facing is our extraordinarily high levels of obesity. The obese patients are becoming more critically ill. We have seen that in 1957, in 1968, in 2000. And in this time, pandemic viral pandemics are more dangerous for the obese person. So we have to identify populations that are more at risk. Some of that geographic, from what we know from Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. And some of that, for instance, New Orleans has twice the death rate as New York right now. And partly that's the underlying conditions and the obesity. But also, in -- within employers, we are not going to discriminate against people. We're not going to shame people that are dealing with obesity, but we must protect them more aggressively and provide them better access to all of the technology we're gaining. And partly why I want to see our economy revived is because I am seeing the enormous suffering of the families and the patients that are dealing with this illness. And we're not really mentioning the economic impact on American health care. New York Presbyterian is $1 billion in the hole last month. Health care workers are out of work and health care workers are in need of hazard pay that are on the front lines. So, our whole country needs to get moving. The president has shown pretty good instincts in this pandemic. One of them is, we can't stay frozen forever. We are going to reopen. And we're going to do it in a tailored fashion, based on demographics, based on risk factors, and based on epidemiology. And we can do this. CAVUTO: Dr. Ahmed, very good catching up with you. Thank you very much. A lot of good ideas there. To the doctor's point, it could be soon. It could be a little sooner than thought. And this breakdown wouldn't be all at once. But this de-lockdown phase is one of the things that the financial markets are looking for. We had a heady advance in the Dow Jones industrials today, better than 550 points. We have retraced more than half the ground we lost through this brutal market response to the coronavirus and the spreading world conditions here, and that despite the sort of earnings season, where we had a couple of doozies, mostly banks reporting today, not exclusively. J&J had much-better-than-expected numbers. That stock was racing along. But the banks, like Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase, not surprisingly, they had warned it would be awful, and it was, but even in some of those cases, investors rewarded them, because it wasn't as awful as they thought, and they think there will be a short shelf life on all of this. As one analyst put it to me earlier today, we know things are bad. We're just happy they're not worse. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: Small business relief, but with a big price tag, and the $360 billion committed to it is nothing compared to the extra $250 billion largely Republicans are leading to make sure it happens. Mike Emanuel with the latest on what appears to be a struggle to get it -- Mike. MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Neil, good afternoon. Yes, this small business program is due to run out of funding by the end of the week. So Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pushing to add another $250 billion to it, saying -- quote -- \"Clean funding for worker pay in a crisis shouldn't be controversial. I hope our Democratic colleagues will let Congress act this week. American workers deserve paycheck, not pink slips caused by political games.\" A top House Republican made this appeal today: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

(END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to convince Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to add funding to other programs, including state and local governments. And she's attacking the Trump administration for implementation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The administration has been very delinquent in how it has managed the supply -- the supply chain and the distribution of what we need to fight this. (END VIDEO CLIP) EMANUEL: Program running out of funding. Now it's a question of which side will blink first -- Neil. CAVUTO: Mike Emanuel in Washington, thank you very, very much. Well, there are a lot of companies -- Google and Apple come to mind, a host of others -- that have come up with technologies to trace coronavirus patients that those with whom they got in contact with. It has gone to the next stage in Massachusetts, where they hope to make that easier than ever. But there are a lot of privacy concerns with that as well. But it's simply been, at its surface, an argument to protect the people. We have got Dr. Sandro Galea right now, Boston University School of Public Health dean. Doctor, what do you make of this technology? I know there are a lot of personal privacy advocates who have issues with it. But looking, if I can, at just the medical benefits of that, or the heads up that people will have about who is contacting whom, who's out there, what do you make of it? DR. SANDRO GALEA, DEAN, BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Well, first of all, this is nothing new. We do contact tracing all the time. Right now, if there's an outbreak of measles, tuberculosis or sexually transmitted disease, including HIV, we do contact tracing. And, essentially, the principle is very simple, is that you identify people who are infected early, and then you find out who they have been in contact with, so that you can test them as well. And the idea is that you contain the disease. So it is not a new concept. I mean, it's a concept that has been around for hundreds of years. And in many respects, it is what we should have done right from the beginning of the COVID epidemic. The fact that we didn't do it really is a reflection of the fact that we were unprepared. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: All right. So, how do we keep track of those contacts? What kind of technology are we using? I know, in the case of the high-tech cases like Google, what have you, how are we monitoring that? GALEA: Well, at a very simple level, you don't need fancy technology. At a simple level, you need a phone to call the people who are infected, find out who their contacts are, and you can document them on a spreadsheet. Now, you can get fancy. You can have apps that document that. You can have apps that talk to each other. My phone can talk to your phone if we have been close to each other, which means that, if I have COVID, you would know that you're at risk of COVID. But the technology is in service of the fundamental issue. The fundamental issue is, we identify people with infection early, we identify their contacts, so we can test them and isolate them to keep disease from spreading. CAVUTO: Do you see this under control, Doctor, from your vantage point, or more under control? What are some of your worries? GALEA: Well, I think we are -- we're probably cresting the epidemic nationally, as you said earlier in your program. I think it's going to take us another couple of months. And we are going to get to a place where we have a chance almost as a do-over, where we're going to have the epidemic down to manageable levels, and then run the risk of having any recurrence or having other spikes, as have happened in other places. So this is our moment. This is our moment to implement contact tracing, where we can find cases quickly to contain it, so, if there are cases of infection, they do not become an outbreak, the outbreak doesn't become an epidemic again, and the epidemic doesn't result again in us having to close down economies and close down the country. But to do that, we need to have testing. We need to identify cases quickly. We need to contact trace, find people who are at risk, isolate and test those people. And contact tracing is at the heart of all of that. CAVUTO: Do you have any worries about beginning this unwinding process, Doctor, May 1? GALEA: Yes and no. I mean, yes, I do. I suppose the operative question is, what you mean by the unwinding? Unwinding has been interpreted in some of the public conversations as being we undo everything, everybody goes back to normal. And that obviously is not the right solution. And -- or unwinding can be, let's take it a step at a time, see where we're at in the epidemic, and slowly start reintroducing contact, while being measured, judicious and making sure that we are monitoring cases and have the testing and the capacity to monitor if cases spread. If that's what we mean by unwinding, then I think it's reasonable to start slowly asking ourselves, how do we slowly reintroduce normal day-to-day life? If by unwinding, we mean changing everything overnight, that's not the right idea. CAVUTO: All right, Doctor, thank you very, very much. We will watch it very, very closely. In Michigan, forget about when to shop. What to shop for -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm so proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States. Choosing Joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions I ever made. And he became a close friend. And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAVUTO: All right, Barack Obama making it official. He has given his blessing to Joe Biden to be the Democratic nominee. Of course, with Bernie Sanders out of the race, it was a foregone conclusion here, even though there are a lot of people trying to recruit folks like Andrew Cuomo to run, saying that Biden might be a weak general election candidate. Be that as it may, it is most likely his nomination to turn down at this point. And the support of Barack Obama, wildly popular in the Democratic Party and elsewhere, will seal the deal and help that. We will get a read of that with Susan Crabtree of RealClearPolitics. Susan, do you know what role the former president played in dealing with Bernie Sanders? There are reports of conversations, maybe your own reporting. And I'm wondering if he kind of prepared the Vermont senator to step out early. What do you know on that front? SUSAN CRABTREE, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Well, it is interesting that we have President Obama coming out and endorsing Biden, his former vice president. At least we can end that sort of Washington parlor game of will he or won't he endorse him, why hasn't he yet? That was going on for more than a year so far now, and even President Trump got into the game. But when you talk about the timing of this, it's very interesting. Sanders, last week, as we know, got out of the race. But he really didn't, keeping his delegates in there, saying he still wanted as many delegates as he could to influence the platform of the party. He has already been a huge influence in the party. And we actually saw that during President Obama's endorsement today, when he said he believed that it was time for real structural reform. That's what really struck me from this endorsement. He was obviously talking a lot about President Trump, without mentioning him by name, talking about the need for competent leadership and honest leadership and somebody who can empathize during this pandemic. But he didn't mention Trump by name. And, instead, he really, at the end of his endorsement video, was talking about how -- endorsing some of the same things that Bernie Sanders was doing, how we need real structural change, and that Joe Biden's platform is the most progressive that we have had from any Democratic nominee in history, and that he needs -- there needs to be a public option to take Obamacare one step further, as well as a bold Green New Deal, and things like $15 federal minimum wage. CAVUTO: I see and notice in a lot of the comments that the former presidents has made that he himself has taken a hard left charge. What do you make of that? CRABTREE: Like I said, it seems like he has. He said in the video that, if it were him running today, it would be a different campaign and a different platform. So you do see this sort of move to the left. And you also -- one of the reasons I believe he didn't come out and endorse Joe Biden right away is he didn't want to alienate progressives in the party that were really beholden to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren throughout the time. CAVUTO: Right. CRABTREE: So, you saw this. This is a real -- a way for President Obama to bring the party together now, but he's also really pushing Joe Biden, it seems to me, to the left, when most candidates during the general election go more towards the center. That's what was striking to me from the video. CAVUTO: Yes, it's very interesting, and still early in the process. We will see how it all falls out. There's no shortage of help the former president provided Hillary Clinton. And that didn't do much good, we know, in retrospect. We will see with Joe Biden. Thank you, Susan, as always. We are waiting to hear, by the way, from the Democratic governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer. She is going to be addressing reporters, not only the latest on the coronavirus and battling it in her fine state, but she has been under fire a little bit, not only over the issue of when people could return to shop, but when they do, what they can and cannot shop for -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: We have just gotten word that the major airlines have come to an agreement with the Treasury on payroll support, part of a $25 billion aid package that the government says is not going to be a grant. It's a loan. We will see -- after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer has a world controversy right now, will soon be addressing reporters, an outcry over her recommendations about what -- when people are in her state ready to shop, what they can shop for and not shop for. It's a little confusing to me, but it isn't to Mike Tobin, who has been following the story quite closely. Mike, what's going on here? MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Neil, there's a protest organized largely on Facebook by a group called the Michigan Conservative Coalition called Operation Gridlock. And they're saying that the executive orders from Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer are too restrictive and arbitrary. So the demonstrators are going to drive over to the Capitol in Lansing and create a big visual by locking up the otherwise empty streets. Now, Whitmer said the family of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is behind it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI): The group is funded in large part by the DeVos family. And I think it's really inappropriate to -- for a sitting member of the United States president's Cabinet to be waging political attacks on any governor. But, obviously, on me here at home, I think that they should disavow it. And I encourage people to stay home and be safe. (END VIDEO CLIP) TOBIN: Now, the connection is the Michigan Freedom Fund, of which Secretary DeVos' husband was a founding member, but he's no longer active. Now, Freedom Fund spent $250 sponsoring an ad for the Conservative Coalition. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wish the governor would focus more on this crisis and coming up with a more nuanced approach to her orders than playing politics and slinging mud like this. (END VIDEO CLIP) TOBIN: And Michigan is now the third most severe state in the nation in terms of infections and deaths -- Neil. CAVUTO: Mike Tobin, thank you very, very much. Well, can the governor do this, even hint at this? Judge Andrew Napolitano with us right now. Is she going as far as her critics say? And if she is, Judge, what are the issues you have? ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, the issue that she's generated are not with me. They're with the Constitution, Neil. And she deserves the political blowback that she's getting. I mean, if you're at a Costco or Walmart, and you want to get groceries and paper towels, but you also want to get grass seed and a garden hose, she's told them they can't sell you the grass seed and the garden hose. They can only sell you the paper towels and the groceries. I mean, there's no rational basis for that type of an order. It also interferes with the intimate choices of people to purchase what they want and what they need. These are people who have already been subject to the maximum number of humans per square footage of the store and are practicing the social distancing while in the store. This is an example, probably the most egregious, of a governor assuming to herself near totalitarian powers, nowhere authorized by the United States Constitution or the constitution of Michigan. So I don't feel sorry for her at all. I'm waiting for one of those people to file a lawsuit because the first federal judge that hears this, I think, will restrain her from enforcing these orders. CAVUTO: What I don't understand is the logic behind it. At first, trying to give the benefit of the doubt, I thought, was she trying to say spread the wealth around, if you want to get some of these other items, go elsewhere, don't let it concentrate at the big box guys? But even that was a stretch. What do you think? NAPOLITANO: I mean, it is central economic planning that we all know has never worked. It doesn't work in time of emergency. If she were divvying out N95 face masks or ventilators, that would be one thing, but to say to people what they can put on their grocery list and what they can't is almost as absurd as our home state governor saying you can't drive between 8:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. It's beyond me what public health benefit that produces. But these governors are getting carried away with issuing decrees, because people are accepting them like sheep. There should be more challenges to more of these things on the streets and in the courts. CAVUTO: But Governor Murphy of New Jersey is allowing that, enforcing that, and getting away with that. NAPOLITANO: Yes. CAVUTO: I'm talking about the driving between 8:00 and 5:00 a.m. And maybe the Michigan governor will feel she's fully justified and empowered to do this now. NAPOLITANO: Without a challenge, whether political, like the Michigan governor is confronting, or legal, as I understand will soon be confronting Governor Murphy, they will just keep changing their minds, rewriting laws, adding punishments. Look, in our system, governors don't write laws, and they don't craft punishments. Legislatures do that, people responsible to the citizenry, after public hearings and public debates. Andrew Cuomo is right. We have a Constitution. We don't have a king. And we don't have a king in each state capital. All right, I will get off my high horse. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: Well, it looks like a beautiful high horse there. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: Judge, thank you very, very much, Judge Andrew Napolitano. By the way, I'm trying to get a little more details on this $25 billion payroll support package that the airlines have signed onto with the government, namely, the Treasury. One of the prior snafus was, the airlines wanted this to have grant potential. In other words, they wouldn't have to pay it back, especially if they kept workers, or backed up their payroll to protect those workers. We don't know how that issue has been settled. We do know that one of the big snafus has been addressed. We just don't know the details of that, just that it could possibly clear the way for a $25 billion rescue, which, with the money the airlines are losing, will probably in the end be chump change, since their business has crashed about 90-plus percent from a little more than a few months ago. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, we still don't know what California Governor Newsom's plans are to reopen California, what will be included, what won't be. But we have an interesting little tidbit that's coming via Reuters right now, that the governor would likely say that mass gatherings, those of hundreds of thousands of people, would likely be banned at least through the summer. That is through the summer. Remember, this is a big concert and convention state, but hundreds of thousands of people -- we don't know where they would put the limit -- that that would be verboten, at least through the summer. How far does this go? What other items are being considered to entertain slowly unwinding the lockdown that exists, or quasi-lockdown that exists, in California? Representative Raul Ruiz joins us right now, Democrat there. What do we know, Representative, what the governor wants to do, what you want to do? Are you on board with the very large gatherings of hundreds of thousands probably not a great idea right away? REP. RAUL RUIZ (D-CA): Well, I know that it's -- this stay-at-home policy has really taken a toll on our economy. But the safety measures in our public health are not in contradiction with the economic factors that we need to take into account, because the economic depression is directly correlated with the rise in transmission of the coronavirus. So, for us to focus on the public health and safety aspects is the right way to help get our economy back in order. And I am in accordance with the social distancing, because it's proven scientifically that the way right now -- without a vaccine or without treatment, the way we're going to get ahold of decreasing the transmission of coronavirus is to practice early and aggressive social distancing measures. CAVUTO: So, if we practice those measures, it's fair to say that a lot of crowded workplaces -- California has plenty of them -- where I am, too, Congressman, it's the same deal -- you're going to have fewer people able to return to work right away. Is that your sense in California as well, whenever this is lifted? RUIZ: Yes, well, we need to take care of not only those that are not in work and practicing social distancing by not being in large gathering outside in public, but we also have to take care of our workers, our essential workers, who need to also practice social distancing within the workplace as well. It's going to take some time, and it's going to be targeted, and it's going to be gradual. I think the governor laid a road map, an aspirational, science-based way to lift the stay-at-home orders in the safest way possible, because we know this, according to the science, that the virus is not going away, that we only have assumed 8 percent of people who have been exposed and have developed immunity. So, we're nowhere near having a population-based natural herd immunity that will protect us. And we're about a year away from developing a vaccine. So, this virus is going to be around, and it's also going to come back during the fall months. So, if we know that's going to happen, then we should develop the systematic framework by helping our hospitals deal better with a surge capacity, by making sure we have the right amount of testing, diagnostic and serology... CAVUTO: All right. RUIZ: ... as well as the capacity to contain the virus once it reappears. And so I think that this was a road map to demonstrate how we can build the framework or the building blocks for the state of California to then give people an expectation that we will lift the stay-at-home orders in the most safe way possible. CAVUTO: Yes, we just need to find out what's on that road map. Congressman, thank you very much. Very good seeing you. Meanwhile, from wise guy to nice guy. You remember, years ago, he was killed off on \"The Sopranos.\" Well, he's back with a vengeance doing some very good deeds. Meet him next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: Maybe they killed off this guy on \"The Sopranos\" prematurely. He's a nice and a wonderful guy. Joseph Gannascoli is with us right now, \"The Sopranos\" actor. A lot of people, you know the face instantly, certainly the voice. But he's doing a lot of good right now helping those who are dealing with the coronavirus in Long Island, New York, and New York City hospitals, getting a lot of important stuff to them, including a lot of delicious food. I'm happy to have him back with us. Joseph, good to see you, my friend. How you doing? JOSEPH GANNASCOLI, ACTOR: I'm doing good, Neil. Thank you. CAVUTO: I love what you're doing. And what gave you the idea for it? Because I know it's grown quite a bit. GANNASCOLI: It has. My sister-in-law works for -- in the labor and delivery in South Nassau. And she was telling me, you know, what they're going through. And I wanted to take you -- this is where my daughter was born. So I wanted to take them lunch. And it sort of started growing. I wanted to do it for other hospitals. And I got to mention the couple of restaurants that have been matching the funds that, when I go there, they just add in so much more. So there's food left for the night crew or to spread around, Vincent's Clam Bar in Long Island, in Carle Place, Long Island, and Villa Maria Restaurant in my neighborhood, East Rockaway. And one of the customers got what we were doing, two brothers from Thomas Novelli contractors, and they made a huge donation. So this allowed me to expand to five -- five hospitals. I did the post office this morning. I'm doing the fire departments in my neighborhood Friday. And I just want to keep it going. So everyone has really been so generous. And, really, these hospital workers, it's just so brave, that it makes me want to keep going. CAVUTO: I have a feeling, Joe -- I know you have a big heart. And I have seen evidence of that over the many, many years. But I think some people are scared of you, frankly. And I think, when you walk into a restaurant (AUDIO GAP) would be a real good idea if you help these people out, they're not going to argue, right? GANNASCOLI: Well, I -- I can be convincing. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: But you get a good response. Now, how do you coordinate? That's a big thing to organize and get to the people on time. How are you doing all that? GANNASCOLI: Well, I got to say one good thing about -- I mean, if there's any good thing about it, there's not much traffic out there. CAVUTO: Well, there is that. GANNASCOLI: Even from -- when I went to Staten Island -- when I went from Long Island, like Roosevelt Field, where Vincent's is, to Staten Island University, I did it in about 35 minutes. So, traffic has been great. CAVUTO: Wow. GANNASCOLI: So that is a help. I pick it up around 11:30. And I'm there about 12:05, 12:10, just in time for lunch. CAVUTO: That's awesome. Now, I know that route you're taking. That would easily be 90 minutes in the old traffic we used to have. What kind of reaction do you get? GANNASCOLI: Oh, just people are so thankful and grateful. And we still do pictures, but it's six feet apart. So I wound up taking pictures for everybody. And I do the selfie. But they're way in back of me. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: Now, are you partial to Italian restaurants? Or you open it up? Of course, a lot of great fish restaurants. You mentioned one. Or do you care? Whoever wants to sign up and help, sign up and help? GANNASCOLI: Well, I try to spread it around to the restaurants in my neighborhood. So, I did them with Italian a few times. I'm thinking about doing some Greek. CAVUTO: OK. GANNASCOLI: And maybe some Mexican, so just to give them a little variation. CAVUTO: How are you holding up through this, Joe, and your family? And this sheltering in place, for a lot of folks, has been driving them nuts. How about you? GANNASCOLI: I have been getting out. I wear my mask, my gloves. I got Padre Pio with me all the time. (LAUGHTER) GANNASCOLI: And I do my rubs. I wash down. But I'm OK. My daughter's loving it. She's having -- she's doing her schoolwork. But she's in the pajamas most of the day. And, well, my wife is... CAVUTO: Yes. There you go. I can imagine, your kids don't do -- your kids don't do your homework, that's going to be a long day, I just have a feeling. So you're -- let's say you're very forceful. Joe, you have a -- you're just a great guy. This -- when I heard about this, I said, we got to get this guy on. It's great seeing you again. Be well and be safe, my friend. GANNASCOLI: Thank you, Neil. And if they can go to my Twitter @JoeRGannascoli, they will see the GoFundMe account. They can make it whatever they can afford, so I can keep this going for as long as I can. Thank you. CAVUTO: Joe, we knew you would want to mention that, so we put it on our site. And we will put it on our site, because we didn't want to upset you, if we didn't. So, Joe just said, I think it'd be a really good idea for you to have those details on your site. And it is. Joseph, thank you very much, my friend. We will have more after this. GANNASCOLI: Thank you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: When you think about it, there have been so many hit hard by the coronavirus, something the president's going to address momentarily, when he has his health care task force briefing minutes from now. But when it comes to groups that seem to be unfairly targeted or disproportionately hit, it has got to be transit workers. More than 50 have lost their lives. And that's what we know right now. It's a big problem in the New York metropolitan area Bryan Llenas on a problem that is not apparently going away, even now -- Bryan. BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, New York's public transit workers are the first responders who go in every day and do their jobs, with little fanfare, each day bringing doctors, nurses, and first responders back and forth from the front line. And it's come at a heavy price. At least 59 MTA employees are now dead, thousands quarantined, thousands also sick. It has come, like I said, at a heavy price. It's more than the FDNY and NYPD combined, in terms of the dead, people like Oliver Cyrus, a 20-year veteran bus operator, remembered as a humble man who did everything for his daughter, Tamia, who was the love of his life. Or Warren Tucker, a maintenance employee, friends called him Big Tuck, remember for his happy personality and Yankees hat. The MTA doing a lot of things to try to separate drivers from passengers, including reducing hand-to-hand cash transactions. And they're doing everything they can thus far, but we will see. Transit unions across the country are very worried moving forward about having enough personal protective equipment for public transit workers nationwide -- Neil. CAVUTO: Yes, I didn't think of that, Bryan. You're right. They are on the front line of this, whether they like it or not. Thank you very much, my friend. All right, the president's briefing coming up. He's also going to be announcing that advisory board that will help him decide if and when he lifts some restrictions on leaving your home.", "tags": ["yourworldcavuto", "transcript"], "published_time": "2020-04-15 16:20:29", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 16:20:34"}

Hawley: Let coronavirus victims sue Chinese Communist Party", "content": "It's time for America to fundamentally rethink its relationship with China, says Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.Sen. Josh Hawley unveiled new legislation this week to allow victims of the to sue the Chinese Communist Party directly for damages by stripping the government of its sovereign immunity.The Missouri Republican said the \"Justice for Victims of COVID-19 Act\" will also create a State Department task force to investigate Beijing's handling of the outbreak and help secure money from the Chinese government for the victims.\"The CCP unleashed this pandemic,\" Hawley said. \"They must be held accountable to their victims.\"There's already two major class-action lawsuits underway against China filed by the Berman Law Group, a Florida-based firm. The original suit was filed in March on behalf of coronavirus victims and another case was brought in April by healthcare professionals suing China for hoarding personal protective equipment. The lawyers on the case argued China's actions met a legal exception for immunity, but Hawley's legislation would bolster the chance for thousands of American victims to receive justice, the lawsuit advocates say.\"I think it's fantastic,\" Jeremy Alters, chief firm strategist at the Berman Law Group and non-attorney spokesman, told Fox News of Hawley's bill. \"I think it shows that he is looking forward to a remedy for this terrible situation that has happened. It will make the hurdles that we have in our lawsuit much easier to clear. And it will allow the people of the United States to recover at least some compensation for what the CCP has done.\"Americans wanting to join the lawsuits can visit: Hawley's legislation would make the Chinese government subject to civil claims filed in U.S. courts. It would also launch an international investigation to determine how Beijing's efforts to conceal and distort information put the world at risk and create a global effort to compel the Chinese government to provide restitution to victims, Hawley's office said.\"There is overwhelming evidence that the Chinese Communist Party's lies, deceit and incompetence caused COVID-19 to transform from a local disease outbreak into a global pandemic,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"We need an international investigation to learn the full extent of the damage the CCP has inflicted on the world and then we need to empower Americans and other victims around the world to recover damages.\"The legislation creates a private right of action against the Chinese government for any reckless action that caused the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, such as withholding information and gagging doctors who warned of the novel coronavirus. The bill strips the Chinese government of sovereign immunity for these actions so that plaintiffs can sue and allows courts to freeze Chinese government assets so victims can enforce their claims.The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) prevents Americans from suing other countries except under specific circumstances. The plaintiffs in the current class action lawsuits claim they fit under the exceptions for commercial activity and \"personal injury or death\" that stems from \"the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\"Plaintiffs have worked around sovereign immunity protections in the past. Victims of the Pan Am 103 flight bombing in 1988 were able to successfully sue Libya, for example.Now, the plaintiffs say, it's time for China to pay up for the widespread sickness and death across the globe that they argue could have been prevented if China had been forthcoming about the virus.\"China should have to pay,\" Alters said. \"After all, they're a world superpower. They had the ability to stop and contain this, in large part, if not altogether.

The White House extended social distancing guidelines through April 30, and has floated the possibility of potentially reopening some areas by May 1.Fauci, though, told the AP that May 1 is \"a bit overly optimistic\" for many areas of the country, while suggesting that much of the social-distancing rules should occur on a \"rolling\" basis, rather than all at once, due to the coronavirus striking different parts of the country at different times over the last several weeks.Fauci also warned, yet again, that once restrictions are rolled back and the economy begins to reopen, there are likely to be new outbreaks of COVID-19.\"I'll guarantee you, once you start pulling back there will be infections,\" Fauci told the AP. \"It's how you deal with the infectious that's going to count.\"He added that the key is \"getting people out of circulation if they get infected, because once you start getting clusters, then you're really in trouble.\"The interview comes after an apparent dust-up between Fauci and Trump.Fauci, on Sunday, acknowledged during an interview on CNN that lives could have been saved had U.S. officials acted earlier, but still defended the Trump administration's response.\"'What would have, what could have,' it's very difficult to go back and say that. I mean, obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that.

The president's tweet clearly exposed media attempts to maliciously push a falsehood about his China decision in an attempt to rewrite history,\" White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement.\"It was Democrats and the media who ignored coronavirus choosing to focus on impeachment instead, and when they finally did comment on the virus it was to attack President Trump for taking the bold decisive action to save American lives by cutting off travel from China and from Europe. Dr. Fauci has been and remains a trusted adviser to President Trump,\" Gidley said.Fauci had to clarify his comments during Monday's White House coronavirus briefing, which turned contentious, saying they were incomplete and that the president was not to blame for the havoc COVID-19 has wreaked on the country.During the briefing, Fauci denied that the president or anybody in the administration had pressured him into clarifying his comments.\"Everything I do is voluntary,\" Fauci said. \"Please don't even imply that.\"Meanwhile, during his interview with the AP, Fauci said his public role is important, but added that briefings can be \"really draining.\" Most of the coronavirus task force briefings last more than an hour -- with Monday's running for nearly two-and-a-half.\"If I had been able to just make a few comments and then go to work, that would have really been much better,\" he told the AP. \"It isn't the idea of being there and answering questions, which I really think is important for the American public.

Here's how the pandemic has affected the activity between both countries. is releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants from detention as part of the ongoing effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus -- and as Democrats and immigrant activist groups call for the mass release of those in custody.Acting Deputy Homeland Security Director Ken Cuccinelli said Tuesday that 693 immigrants in custody have been identified for release, due to being more vulnerable to the virus and its effects. He noted that ICE has a long history of dealing with people coming across the border with infectious diseases, but this is an \"unprecedented\" situation.\"As a special response to this particular crisis, ICE has instructed its field offices to further assess for the purpose of considering releases of certain individuals deemed to be at greater risk of exposure,\" he told reporters.The first round, of which about 160 were released, consisted of those over 60 or pregnant. But then the agency did a top-to-bottom review of all those in custody and identified hundreds more from broader categories who could be released -- including those with lung or other related conditions.\"ICE continues to reevaluate all individuals in custody who make up vulnerable populations and they've been modifying practices based on recommendations of the CDC,\" Cuccinelli said.Cuccinelli said that when working out who to release, officials also considered a broad range of other factors including immigration history, any criminal record, the potential threat to public safety, potential flight risk and any national security risks.As a nod to concerns that releasing immigrants into the public could increase the risk to the public at large, Cuccinelli said that ICE not only gives migrants regular health assessments, but it also practices cohorting -- whereby those who have been exposed to a symptomatic detainee are cohorted as a group for the duration of the incubation period.The 693 is only a sliver of the approximately 34,000 illegal immigrants in ICE detention across the country, but represents one of a number of measures law enforcement is taking to protect the public, those in custody and law enforcement from the virus.While left-wing groups and Democrats have been calling for releases of immigrants because of COVID, they are unlikely to be happy with such a relatively small number. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., on Monday introduced a bill that would release \"most\" illegal immigrants in custody.\"Detention centers are like a ticking time bomb -- they are severely at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak, considering the close quarters in which detainees are housed and a population with much higher rates of underlying health issues,\" Booker said in a statement. \"We have an obligation to do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly disease, and that means moving people out of detention centers when they do not pose a public safety risk.\"Notably, under that bill, released illegal immigrants would not return to detention once the emergency has ended unless there was a determination that an individual was a public threat or a flight risk.The Trump administration has given no indication that it is considering anything but a limited release of migrants specifically at risk of COVID-19. Those who are released will be given alternatives to detention, which could include restrictions such as ankle bracelets.Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials said that so far there are no deaths in custody or among releases of the disease -- and emphasized that enforcement actions against those in the country illegally are continuing, including deportation flights.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "politics", "illegal"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 16:02:14", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 16:39:52"}

According to a by Ballotpedia, 24 states and the District of Columbia permit someone chosen by the voter to return mail ballots on their own, with nine of those states adding some specific exceptions.Twelve states outline who specifically can return ballots (i.e., family members or caregivers); and one state explicitly requires only voters can return their ballots. Eleven states establish a limit on the number of ballots that a so-called \"harvester\" can return.Imposing restrictions on the practice has led to legal challenges. In Arizona, a federal appeals court , despite a claim that it unfairly discriminated against minorities who might need help filling out their ballots.Some prominent examples of ballot harvesting have already impacted national politics. In 2016, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law AB1921, which legalized ballot harvesting. Previously, only a family member or someone living in the same household was permitted to drop off mail ballots for a voter, but the new allowed anyone -- including political operatives -- to collect and return them for a voter.The move apparently led to results. In 2018, despite holding substantial leads on Election Day, many Republican candidates in California saw their advantages shrink, and then disappear, as late-arriving Democratic votes were counted in the weeks following the election. Many observers pointed to the Democrats' use of ballot harvesting as a key to their success in the elections. \"Anecdotally, there was a lot of evidence that ballot harvesting was going on,\" Neal Kelley, the registrar for voters in Southern California's Orange County, told Fox News at the time.In Orange County -- once seen as a Republican stronghold in the state -- every House seat went to a Democrat after an unprecedented \"250,000\" vote-by-mail drop-offs were counted, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\"People were carrying in stacks of 100 and 200 of them. We had had multiple people calling to ask if these people were allowed to do this,\" Kelley said.Orange County Republican Chairman Fred Whitaker \"directly caused the switch from being ahead on election night to losing two weeks later.\"Later, in 2019, a GOP operative in North Carolina related to alleged ballot harvesting there.\"The evidence that we will provide today will show that a coordinated, unlawful and substantially resourced absentee ballot scheme operated in the 2018 general election\" in parts of North Carolina's 9th Congressional District, former state elections director Kim Strach remarked at the time.The results in the race were eventually thrown out amid concerns of ballot harvesting and other fraud.

Crowds swarm Stockholm's waterfront, with some people sipping cocktails in the sun. In much of the world, this sort of gathering would be frowned upon or even banned.So far, Sweden has banned gatherings larger than 50 people, closed high schools and universities, and urged those over 70 or otherwise at greater risk from the virus to self-isolate.The softer approach means that schools for younger children, restaurants and most businesses are still open, creating the impression that Swedes are living their lives as usual. Yet as Johan Klockar watches his son kick a ball around a field during a soccer practice in Stockholm, the 43-year-old financial analyst says it's not like that. He and his wife work from home and avoid unnecessary outings. They socialize in a very small circle and limit their son's contacts to people he sees at school or soccer practice.\"Society is functioning, but I think it's quite limited,\" Klockar said. \"Other than this sort of situation -- schools, soccer practice -- we basically stay at home.\" And while most businesses in Sweden are still operating, the economic cost of the pandemic is already being felt. Last week, 25,350 Swedes registered as unemployed, according to the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce -- a larger increase than during the 2008 financial crisis.In contrast, just across a narrow strip of sea, neighboring Denmark is already talking about reopening society. They imposed a much stricter lockdown four weeks ago, closing borders, schools and businesses. This week, the prime minister said by acting early, Denmark averted the tragedy that struck hard-hit nations like and , and will be ready after for a slow return to normal life that starts with reopening preschools and primary schools. For weeks, the numbers of COVID-19 cases and fatalities were proportionally similar between Sweden and Denmark, but while the economic results of the strict isolation are being felt in Denmark, Sweden's mortality rate has reached more than 88 dead per million, compared with around 47 dead per million in Denmark.Sweden, with a population of 10 million, has registered around 900 deaths, while Denmark, with 5.8 million people, has more than 270 deaths.Sweden may be paying a heavy price for embracing the idea of -- that is, letting many individuals get sick to build up immunity in the population. Swedish Health Minister Lena Hallengren recently told The Associated Press: \"We have never had a strategy for herd immunity.\"Sweden stands out for what Anders Tegnell, the country's chief epidemiologist and top strategist in the COVID-19 fight, calls a \"low-scale\" approach that \"is much more sustainable\" over a longer period. The 63-year-old has become a household name in Sweden, appearing across the media and holding daily briefings outlining the progression of the outbreak with a precise, quiet demeanor.He insists that Sweden's approach still seems to make sense, though he also acknowledges that the world is in uncharted territory with the virus. He argues that while Sweden might have more infections in the short term, it will not face the risk of a huge infection spike that Denmark might face once its lockdown is lifted.\"I think both Norway and Denmark are now very concerned about how you stop this complete lockdown in a way so you don't cause this wave to come immediately when you start loosening up,\" he said.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "world"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 15:37:13", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 16:26:20"}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.It's a story that spans decades, exposes and shows the lengths Bloomberg L.P. will go to protect its profit.It begins in China in 2012, when a team of at Bloomberg News started investigating the ties between the Communist Party and the country's wealthiest citizens.Their reporting hit a little too close to home and the higher-ups at Bloomberg News killed it, firing the reporter who questioned the decision and attempted to silence his wife by pressuring her for years to sign a non-disclosure agreement.The incredible story, on Tuesday, untangles the twisty tale behind Bloomberg's decision to cave to threats by China's ruling party because they were worried about repercussions by Beijing. Instead of standing by their reporters, Bloomberg turned on them and took it a step further when it tried to get author Leta Hong Fincher, the wife of then-Bloomberg Beijing correspondent Mike Forsythe, to also keep quiet.\"They assumed that because I was the wife of their employee, I was the wife,\" she told NPR. \"I was just an appendage of their employee. I was not a human being.\"A Bloomberg News spokesperson declined to comment to Fox News.Forsythe was part of Bloomberg's team of reporters looking into the mass accumulation of wealth by China's ruling class. Their investigative reporting got them on Beijing's radar, and the Chinese ambassador purportedly warned Bloomberg executives about publishing further exposes.Forsythe pressed on, despite receiving death threats.The team's next round of reporting focused on Chinese leaders' ties to Wang Jianlin, the country's richest man, as well as the family of President Xi Jinping. At first, Bloomberg editors seemed to be excited about digging deeper into China's most influential leaders, but soon the media outlet's bigwigs back home decided to drop the story.In October 2013, Matthew Winkler, Bloomberg's founding editor-in-chief, was caught on video admitting that the piece would \"you know, invite the Communist Party to, you know, completely shut us down and kick us out of the country. So, I just don't see that as a story that is justified.\"In audio made available to NPR, Winkler suggested that Bloomberg reporters find another way to cover the story -- a friendlier path that wouldn't ruffle as many feathers.\"It has to be done with a strategic framework and a tactical method that is ... smart enough to allow us to continue and not run afoul of the Nazis who are in front of us and behind us everywhere,\" he said. \"And that's who they are. And we should have no illusions about it.\"When asked, Winkler said at the time that the story needed additional reporting.The problem: That's not what the audio revealed.Instead, it offered a disturbing peek into how much editors were worried about losing millions of dollars in business deals in China.Bloomberg's terminals have been a huge moneymaker for the company. Subscribers have paid about $20,000 a year for each, which provides financial data and news stories. The more money Bloomberg makes on its terminals, the more traction and name recognition its news division gets. But just as the investigation into China's ruling class was in full swing, Bloomberg's business opportunities in China were seen as a cash cow.Around the same time, Michael Bloomberg had been elected mayor of New York City. He claimed multiple times he had nothing to do with Bloomberg News, but NPR and Bloomberg's own reporters say he was in frequent contact and shared his vision for expansion in China.This directly contradicts statements he repeatedly made.He also shot down the idea that Bloomberg News would ever back down from publishing a story.\"Nobody thinks we are wusses and not willing to stand up and write stories that are of interest to the public and that are factually correct,\" he said at a news conference while he was still mayor.After his tenure, he returned to the company that bore his name and held a \"town hall\" in early 2014 where he purportedly singled out a few \"bad apples\" that some took to mean the reporters covering China, NPR reported.Bloomberg News had suspended and then fired Forsythe in late 2013, accusing him of leaking plans to kill the story to other news outlets.Forsythe signed a nondisclosure agreement and has not spoken on the topic.That wasn't good enough for the business behemoth.The company's team of lawyers then targeted his wife, threatening to force the couple of pay back thousands of dollars they used to move after they were told their lives were in danger. The company also threatened to sue the couple if Fincher didn't sign a nondisclosure agreement, or NDA, something she told NPR was absurd.\"There was no reason why I should have to sign a nondisclosure agreement because I didn't possess any damaging material about the company,\" she said.Then she and her husband were instructed to go to the offices of Bloomberg's Hong Kong-based legal team.Fincher said the bizarre meeting began with a giant projection of Bloomberg's outside counsel in New York City.He demanded she sign an NDA.

He said that the state should have a timeline prepared in about two weeks.\"There is no light switch here, it is more like a dimmer,\" he said, noting that stricter measures could be implemented again if the state begins to see more infections. As of Tuesday there just under 24,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, with 715 deaths, according to statistics compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. These numbers are far lower than were predicted even with social distancing put in place.Newsom said the state is moving into an \"optimistic phase\" in the battle against the virus before laying out the parameters that need to be met before the stay-at-home orders are lifted. The plan calls for enhanced testing and contact tracing, monitoring of vulnerable segments of the population, addressing needs of hospitals to deal with any additional surges of the virus, continuing to work with researchers on therapeutic treatments, creating a plan for safely reopening businesses, schools and other institutions, and preparing Californians for what he called \"turning the faucet back on.\"\"The process could be the most challenging,\" Newsom said, noting that stricter measures could be reinstated once lifted if infections continue. Newsom also made clear a number of times throughout the press conference that residents should not let down their guards and they should continue to practice social distancing in an effort to further impede the virus' spread.\"We are not out of the woods yet, we are not spiking the ball,\" he said.California's plan comes a day after Newsom - along with Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee - announced an agreement for reopening their states' economies and controlling COVID-19 into the future.The governors said health outcomes and science, not politics, would drive decision-making. Any modifications to each state's stay-at-home order will be grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the health impacts of COVID-19, they added, saying no large-scale reopening will take place until metrics reflected a significant decline in the spread of the virus.A number of states in the Northeast - including New York, which has been the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. - announced a similar plan on Monday.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "politics", "gavin-newsom", "california"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 15:47:59", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 17:18:52"}

So why is it planning on opening? Perhaps the reality of its fiscal crisis is too stark for even to ignore.Just how big is the state budget? The answer is over $214 billion annually between money that the legislature appropriated and voter-approved bond spending. The next closest state is New York at approximately $180 billion.For their part, California's 58 county governments spend over $80 billion per year and its 482 city governments spend about the same. The state also has government entities known as special districts that spend $70 billion per year, transit operators that spend $10 billion annually and transportation planning agencies that spend about $4.5 billion.All combined, government entity spending in California approaches half a trillion dollars each year. That tally is almost 15 percent of the total state economy and doesn't include $100 billion in federal funds spent by California's state government each year.The problem facing all those California governments is revenue shortfalls caused by the government-mandated shutdowns. The state, and its cities and counties, rely on sales tax, use taxes, hotel occupancy taxes (cities), gas taxes, property taxes (local governments) and business operations taxes. Of course, the state also relies on income taxes.All of those tax collections will be less than what was budgeted at the start of the current fiscal years. While it is not clear exactly when shutdown in California will be ended, it is clear that at least three months of those expected tax revenues - a quarter of the fiscal year - or more, will be severely impacted.That impact is highlighted by estimates that one-third or more of California restaurants may not reopen, that car dealerships can only survive between one and three months, and that farmers, who continue to be shorted on water allocations, will have fallow fields -- and on and on.Of course, all of those lost businesses will result in empty storefronts throughout California. Empty storefronts reduce property values, which means lower property tax collections. Keep in mind that California governments collect $75 billion per year in property tax and most of that is paid by business/investment property owners.Overall, and in very real economic terms, when California does lift its coronavirus shutdown, the state's economy will be smaller than when the shutdown started - and smaller economies kick off less revenue.Raising taxes during a weak economy is like handing weights to struggling swimmer.Meanwhile, to deal with the crisis, spending has risen at all levels of government in California. The full amount has yet to be determined.So, what will California do to combat its economic slowdown and budget deficits? Well, you can expect federal government bailout requests to be made. However, the precedent implications of federal government bailouts of state and local budget deficits limit that possibility.That leaves tax increases. California already has the highest state sales tax, the highest gas taxes (61.2 cents per gallon), highest income tax, the eighth-highest business taxes (highest in the West, though), and property taxes in the top third of the nation.Not satisfied with those statistics, on the ballot this fall in California is an effort to raise property taxes. (Apparently, California's tax lovers and big-spenders want to be first in tax collection in every possible category.)The goal is to overturn the property tax protections enshrined in Proposition 13, which set off a wave of tax reform throughout the country - a wave Ronald Reagan rode to the White House. Under Prop 13, property taxes are set at one percent of a property's market value at the time of acquisition and annual increases are limited to no more than 2 percent per year.According to the proponent's estimates, property tax receipts could increase by as much as $12 billion - more revenue than the budgets of 12 states. In other words, they want to extract $12 billion out of the private sector as it struggles with the shutdown aftermath.Raising taxes during a weak economy is like handing weights to struggling swimmer. Keep in mind that California already ranks at the very bottom of places to start a new business. As an attorney who has represented small businesses in this state for over 30 years, I can tell you the struggle is real.Extracting $12 billion more out of landlords with empty storefronts and mortgages to pay, is a recipe for further economic decline, lower property values and, therefore, lower tax receipts. In other words, the tax increase will make fiscal matters even worse for California governments over time.That Prop 13 battle will only be the beginning, however. Cities, counties and the state, with their $750 billion-plus infrastructure deficit, their even worse long-term pension shortfalls and other debts won't stop there in their quest for new revenue.California is leading the states in government spending, taxes, debt and the need to solve budget deficits.

THE USA MUST HAVE VOTER I.D., THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN HONEST COUNT!\"Ballot harvesting - also known as vote harvesting - is political speak for a practice in which organized workers, activists, or volunteers collect absentee or mail-in ballots and drop them off at a polling location or election office. It's legal in some states and illegal in others. The term - which carries a negative connotation - suggests voting improprieties or even election fraud.Republicans claim that ballot harvesting in California in 2018 - where it was legal - helped Democrats sweep U.S. House races, and regain the majority in the chamber. But a case of ballot harvesting in a 2018 congressional race in North Carolina - where the practice was illegal - led to a new special election and charges against a Republican operative.Meanwhile, in Nevada, The tweet by the president comes a week after he argued at a daily Coronavirus Task Force press briefing at the White House that \"mail-in voting is horrible. It's corrupt.\"Trump then suggested that \"you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in someone's living room signing ballots all over the place. ... I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing.\" The president didn't offer evidence to back up his claim that voting by mail is rampant with fraud and abuse.The president's comments follow a similar attack on voting by mail just days earlier, when he charged that \"a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.\"\"It shouldn't be mail-in voting,\" Trump added. \"It should be: you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don't send it in the mail where people can pick up.

While Trump crushed Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College vote to win the White House, the Democratic nominee topped Trump by nearly 3 million votes in the national popular count.When a reporter pointed out last week that the president voted by mail in Florida's primary election last month, Trump responded saying, \"Sure. I can vote by mail ... because I'm allowed to.\"\"I happened to be at the White House,\" the president said, explaining that he wasn't able to go to Florida - where he's registered to vote - to cast a ballot in person.The president argued that \"there's a big difference between somebody's that out-of-state and does a ballot and everything's sealed, certified, and everything else\" and the increasingly popular use of mail-in voting and absentee balloting for voters who are not out of state. \"There's a lot of dishonesty going along with mail-in voting,\" Trump said.Five states - Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington - vote entirely by mail. A majority of states allow no-excuse absentee balloting.With the coronavirus outbreak forcing social distancing and keeping most Americans in their homes in hopes of preventing a spread of the virus, calendar was upended, with many states delaying their remaining primary elections or transforming them nearly entirely to voting by mail and absentee balloting -- though the presidential primary is now essentially over.Among the states moving to the vote-by-mail option The state's in-person voting - which was scheduled for March 17 - was scrapped at the last minute due to coronavirus health concerns.Under a bill passed by the state's legislature and signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, postcards are being sent to every registered voter to explain how they can obtain a vote-by-mail application. Ballots must be postmarked by April 27 to be counted. The state will allow an extremely limited group of people - mostly disabled voters - to cast a ballot in person on April 28.But last week Wisconsin became the first state to hold in-person voting during the pandemic.Two last-minute moves by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and allied progressive and voting rights groups to postpone in-person voting and extend the deadline to vote by absentee ballot due to health concerns amid the pandemic were opposed by the GOP-controlled legislature and squashed by Wisconsin's conservative-dominated Supreme Court.And a push to extend absentee balloting was also shot down by a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that was supported by the justices nominated by Republican presidents and opposed by those nominated by Democrats.With the state under a stay-at-home order, thousands of poll workers refused to show up over health concerns, forcing many cities and towns to cut the number of polling stations. Milwaukee was down to just five polling sites from the original 180.Even though the National Guard stepped in to provide some assistance, long lines instantly formed as the polls opened, with many voters waiting hours to cast a ballot. In many instances, social distancing was extremely difficult to maintain.Democrats in Wisconsin and across the nation decried the rulings to carry on with the in-person voting during the pandemic. The partisan fight in Wisconsin the past few days is the first battle in the broader political war between Democrats and Republicans over expanding voting by mail and absentee balloting for November's general election. recently predicted \"there's going to be a great deal more absentee balloting\" in the general election. And last week the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee emphasized in a \"Today\" show appearance that it's time to start looking into what it \"would take to have voting by mail.\"The $2 trillion economic stimulus package passed by Congress and signed into law by the president two weeks ago - which aims to help workers, small businesses and large companies devastated by the shutdown of much of the nation's economy due to the pandemic, as well as provide aid to hospitals on the front lines in the crisis - also included $400 million to help states move toward mail-in voting.Senate Democrats had pushed for $2 billion in election funding, with House Democrats angling for double that amount. Congressional Democrats say they'll work to increase funding in the next stimulus package.A released last month spotlighted sweeping changes to current voting practices across the country - such as universal mail-in voting, ballot drive-by drop off boxes from coast to coast, and easier online voter registration - to make voting in November safe. Their price tag to implement the changes was $2 billion.The push by Democrats will face plenty of opposition from the president and Republicans, who've long opposed moves to expand voting by mail and early voting by arguing that it invites voter fraud abuse. Democrats - pushing back on such arguments - say that cases of actual voter fraud are limited and claim that Republicans are trying to suppress voter turnout to improve their chances of winning elections.Republican National Committee- in a recent opinion piece for Fox News - claimed that the election reforms pushed by Democrats would \"vastly expand opportunities for fraud and weaken confidence in our elections, but all Washington Democrats see is a potential benefit for their party.\"The RNC and the Trump reelection campaign launched a joint multimillion-dollar legal campaign to block attempts by Democrats to change voting rules in states across the country amide the coronavirus pandemic.The Democratic National Committee - in pushing back against the GOP efforts - is teaming up with state Democratic parties to help voters obtain absentee ballots.\"We must ensure moving forward that voters have [the] choice to either cast a ballot remotely through mail, cast a ballot through early voting, cast a ballot on Election Day,\" DNC Chairman Tom Perez told reporters on Tuesday, noting some Republican governors are on board.", "tags": ["elections", "politics", "coronavirus", "2020-presidential-election", "donald-trump", "trump-2020-campaign", "joe-biden", "wisconsin", "ohio"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 14:51:28", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 15:41:48"}

At the , just two nurses are looking after 40 patients at a time in the coronavirus quarantine wing. It's the kind of facility that's particularly vulnerable to a coronavirus wildfire that has raged through the nation's frail, elderly long-term care populations, claiming more than 4,000 lives. Nearly all of Canterbury's residents rely on Medicaid funding for the care of health problems that in many cases were the product of a lifetime of poverty. It lacks the amenities and space to keep people apart. And it lacks the pay to hire and keep enough staff. \"A publicly funded nursing home is a virus' dream,\" said Dr. Jim Wright, Canterbury's medical director. \"It is the best place for a virus to be. People are close together. Their immune systems are compromised. It is just a tinderbox for that match.\"Studies have shown nursing homes heavily dependent on Medicaid for revenue have fewer nurses and other staff per patient than average, and lower quality of care overall. And some of the biggest outbreaks so far have been at homes tied closely to the government payment program, including ones in Wayne, W.Va., and the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in New York.Canterbury, which had about 160 residents before its outbreak, was thrown into turmoil from the first COVID-19 diagnosis on March 18. \"You pick any element, or any arena in our facility that needed to be up and running at its best and nothing was,\" Wright said.Exactly how the coronavirus got into Canterbury is not clear. Tests were available but scarce at the beginning of the outbreak. Canterbury was not initially able to test all of its residents and staff because of guidance from state and national officials at the time. By the time tests were conducted on everyone at Canterbury about two weeks after the first confirmed case, more than half the residents infected with coronavirus showed no symptoms of the disease.\"It's impossible to build walls around something that spreads so insidiously,\" said Dr. Danny Avula, the state health department's area director who has noted that Canterbury has been doing its best.Canterbury's death toll has surpassed the , where a special federal group of doctors and nurses was sent to help.Since then, several governors have used their emergency power to do the same for their states.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced public schools will be closed for the rest of the year due to the coronavirus. More mayors and governors will likely make similar announcements if they have not already done so.Rather than look upon this as a negative, I suspect some parents are enjoying new relationships with their children that full-time work and daycare did not . This new bonding experience could lead some to continue the practice of educating their children at home once this crisis has passed and public schools reopen.At a March 27 coronavirus White House briefing, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said, \"Distance learning is happening. States like New Hampshire and Florida have implemented phased and tiered approaches to meet the needs of students in their states. Other and states are implementing creative approaches and working through practical realities to help students continue learning.\"Responding to suggestions that not all children can be reached because they lack internet access, DeVos added, \"In remote Colorado mountain towns without internet connectivity, teachers are putting weekly learning packets together and they're holding office hours by phone to help their students when they're stuck. South Carolina is deploying 3,000 buses with mobile WiFi hotspots to help kids in remote areas access learning that way.\"On March 30, Ireland's RTE television network began showing \"Home School Hub,\" a one-hour program that homebound primary school children \"will be able to watch, download and engage with curriculum-based content, project work, and fun activities that will keep them entertained and learning.\"Some parents might find learning at home to be beneficial beyond additional bonding with their children. Concerns about what is taught in public schools - from sex education to incomplete or even biased views of American history, as well as their failure to uphold moral and spiritual principles (and in some cases undermining them) have made homeschooling attractive to growing numbers of parents.According to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI), \"There are about 2.5 million homeschool students in grades K-12 in the United States. ... It appears that the homeschool population is continuing to grow (at an estimated 2 percent to 8 percent per annum over the past few years).\"The United States is not the only country in which home education is increasingly popular. NHERI reports, \"Other nations (e.g., Australia, Canada, France, Hungary, Japan, Kenya, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand, and the United Kingdom) have also seen increases in homeschooling. It says home education cuts across virtually all demographic lines and not just conservative Christians. These additionally include, \"libertarians, and liberals; low, middle, and high-income families; black, Hispanic, and white; parents with Ph.D.s, GEDs, and no high-school diplomas.\"A study by Noel, Stark, & Redford (2013) found that \"32 percent of homeschool students are Black, Asian, Hispanic, and others (i.e., not White/non-Hispanic).\"The first public school in what was to become the United States was established on April 23, 1635, by Philemon Pormont, a Puritan settler. While for boys only, it was thought at the time that instilling religion and the Bible were essential to a well-rounded education. That was true until the 20th century when court decisions, not the popular will, outlawed collective prayer and Bible reading.Public education remains the single biggest monopoly in America. Most politicians, with exceptions in some states, won't allow school choice because they fear the wrath of teachers unions and the loss of campaign contributions.For those who are able, homeschooling is becoming an attractive option.

With concerns being raised about the possibility of a mass outbreak in traditional facilities for the homeless like tightly packed shelters and group homes, the Department of Veterans Affairs last week announced that it was setting up a temporary tent city on the grounds of its sprawling campus on Los Angeles Westside. Sitting in a parking lot adjacent to the Los Angeles National Veterans Park and tucked between the posh neighborhoods of Brentwood and Westwood is a cluster of about 25 tents draped in blue tarps - spaced at least six feet apart - that has become home to a handful of homeless veterans during the coronavirus pandemic. The temporary tent city, the city's first legal one in almost four decades, also features toilets, handwashing stations, food stations and medical and psychiatric care. The move to set up a legal tent city comes after a homeless man tested positive for COVID-19 while staying at a shelter in the San Fernando Valley and after 68 homeless people and two staff workers contracted the virus at a shelter in San Francisco.The campground on the VA's land is part of a wider move by local, state and federal officials to protect the state's more than 151,000 homeless individuals from contracting the coronavirus. Homeless encampments have for years been a ubiquitous sight around Los Angeles with small tent cities cropping up everywhere from freeway overpasses and alleyways to city parks and in front of public buildings. While both the city and the state have spent billions of dollars to tackle a crisis that continues to grow day by day and build more affordable housing, progress has been slow and the coronavirus has spurred an impetus to quickly find a stopgap measure to handle both crises. In Los Angeles County - home to 44,000 homeless people, including 2,900 veterans - that has meant formerly allowing homeless encampments to remain in place as well as installing handwashing stations, portable toilets and weekly shower services in camps. Under the law, homeless tents in the city must come down between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. but the mandate is not rigidly enforced.Under a plan called Project Roomkey, the city is also trying to rent out 15,000 hotel rooms to house some of the state's largest concentration of homeless during the pandemic. This is equal to the 15,000 hotel rooms California Gov. Gavin Newsom has promised to pay for with money from the federal government. \"People experiencing homelessness are among the most vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19,\" Newsom said last month. \"California is deploying massive resources to get these vulnerable residents safely into shelter, removing regulatory barriers and securing trailers and hotels to provide immediate housing options for those most at risk.\"The move is part of a three-pronged LA County effort to get people indoors and safely distanced from one another. The county is also setting up medical sheltering sites with quarantine and isolation rooms for people who have tested positive for COVID-19, show symptoms while awaiting test results, or who have been exposed to the virus. In addition, temporary shelters have been set up at city and county parks and recreation centers, with beds placed at the recommended distance of at least 6 feet apart.\"We're going big in LA,\" said Heidi Marston, interim director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. \"We based our goal on what the need is here.\" In San Francisco Mayor London Breed recently issued an emergency declaration that allowed the city to rent 30 recreational vehicles to house any homeless individuals who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The city is also planning to rent 7,000 hotel rooms for the homeless.San Diego recently moved more than 800 homeless individuals into a temporary open congregate shelter in the city's convention center and is looking for hotel rooms for others.", "tags": ["america-together", "politics", "homeless-crisis", "coronavirus", "local", "california"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 14:16:46", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 14:46:28"}

And a key part of his platform is a public option, modeled after Medicare. A public option was originally part of then-President Obama's wide-ranging health care reform plan, which was proposed in 2009. But Obama dropped it due to a lack of legislative support ahead of a crucial Senate vote on ObamaCare early in 2010. The lack of a public option in the resulting Affordable Care Act, which was passed into law, was always a sore point for progressives.In 2016, during the waning months of his second and final term in the White House, Obama renewed his push for a public option just days after then-Democratic presidential nominee spotlighted her support for the proposal.Fast forward four years and now Biden is also pushing for a public option. The proposal's been a key part of his domestic agenda since he launched his campaign a year ago. Health care has been a leading and divisive issue in the Democratic presidential primaries from the start of the campaign last year. - who was Biden's last remaining rival for the nomination until he suspended his bid last week and endorsed the former vice president on Monday - has long advocated for a government-run \"Medicare-for-all\" health care system. The proposal's been the signature issue in Sanders' back-to-back 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.Last week, the day after Sanders suspended his presidential campaign, Biden showcased a new proposal to lower from the current age of 65 to age 60 - as well as to forgive student loan debt for low-income and middle-class families - as part of a pitch to woo Sanders and his legions of progressive and younger supporters.In unveiling the plan, Biden credited and his supporters for his embrace of the proposals.\"Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I'm proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis,\" Biden said.The move is a step toward Sanders' \"Medicare-for-all\" proposal, but it doesn't go as far as the senator's plan, which calls for phasing in all Americans over a four-year period and phasing out private health insurance plans.Obama - in his video on Tuesday - spotlighted his former vice president's progressive credentials.The former president emphasized that \"we have to look to the future.

This is true more so than ever during this difficult time. The pandemic has changed the ways Americans live their lives,\" he continued. \"Religious communities have rallied to the critical need to protect the community from the spread of this disease by making services available online and in ways that otherwise comply with social distancing guidelines.\"Barr added: \"The United States Department of Justice will continue to ensure that religious freedom remains protected if any state or local government, in their response to COVID-19, singles out, targets, or discriminates against any house of worship for special restrictions.\"The church had been conducting the services for the past three weeks in accordance with social distancing rules, the Alliance Defending Freedom said. Simmons' ban orders church buildings closed for in-person and drive-in services.\"Churches are strongly encouraged to hold services via Facebook Live, Zoom, Free Conference Call, and any and all other social media, streaming and telephonic platforms,\" the mayor's office said in a press release last week.But the governor's shelter-in-place order did not place a specific ban on drive-in services.\"Thank you to the Trump administration and Attorney General Bill Barr for this strong stand in support of religious liberty,\" Mississippi Gov.

From the way I'm going to the gym, from interacting at business meetings, how to get deals done and just the normalcy of life; the way we shop and engage our friends. So now with my daily routine, everything is in-house -- all of my meetings either via phone or Zoom.And as far as my workouts, I'm working out in front of my house or in the backyard or around the corner down the street. There's no gym. I'm working out by myself instead of working out with a group of people. So that's definitely different.And also, as far as my daily routine, going out to eat and interacting. Of course, there's no going out to eat right now. So right now I've had to pick up a couple new habits of cooking and I'm paying more attention to my cooking now. It definitely has changed a lot. It's definitely been quite a shift, to say the least.: The challenges are being able to get more creative in the house. Take workouts, for example. Usually, you want to go play basketball or do different things to get your cardio in, and weight training and all that stuff. A lot of people don't have that...And probably just the motivation to get around your house and being self-motivated to do that.When it comes to the business, especially being a venture capitalist, a lot of my business is amongst groups of people and interactions like one-on-ones and meeting up at places and coffee shops and doing presentations in front of groups of people -- that's a big part of my business. Not being able to do that is definitely tough. I'm doing business on Zoom now.Being a public speaker, as well, a lot of stuff I want to do as far as public speaking, those events have all been canceled naturally. So now I got to figure out a creative way of doing public speaking online.

Poor would have passed out if had posse comitatus-ed Indiana. Or remember when sympathized with Texans who were ready to secede from the union over... wait for it... excessive federal deficit spending?On the other hand, you have the presumptive Democratic nominee who gets no respect -- like when he asked his father to take him ice fishing and he told him to wait until the weather got warmer.The moves by former President and Biden's runner-up, Vermont Sen. ,to offer full-throated endorsements of Biden so early in the process may look like power moves, but they're exactly the opposite.Biden has no control of his party and is by no means its leader. Democrats nationally would be to House Speaker or the governors of large states for leadership before they would look to Biden.That's only partly due to Biden's relative weakness as a presumptive nominee. It's also about the unusual circumstances of this plague-year election. But more than either, it's about the asymmetrical advantages in re-election cycles, especially in our era of weak parties and strong partisanship.If you doubt us, try a thought experiment. Imagine that Biden had said something as radically transgressive of progressive beliefs as Trump did about the conservative shibboleth of decentralized authority and the 10th Amendment.Let's say Biden held a press conference and declared in a loud, angry way that health care was not a right, but rather a service that should be governed by market forces in the manner of other products.Would the response be an from a congresswoman? Some from intellectuals? More like absolute, innards-boiling outrage. Biden would at once be in danger of losing the nomination. It would be a moral panic.Now, let's stipulate the obvious here. Republicans at all levels have long grown accustomed to Trump's verbal excesses. And since back in the early days when Republicans in Congress eye-rolled Trump's demand to abolish the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, they have learned to take him neither literally nor seriously about some things.If Trump were to start ordering New York barbershops to start cutting hair again or withholding relief to states that did not comply, the response would likely be far more intense.Let's also acknowledge that it has ever been thus: Incumbent presidents are the leaders of their parties. Even in the time when parties were strong and partisanship was much weaker, presidents were still the stud ducks.But it's more intense now. Just look at how the RNC fed itself to the Trump campaign months ago and how state parties rigged the primary calendar to avoid potential embarrassments. Obama was something of a sun king himself eight years ago, but Trump is the party and the party is Trump. So if Republicans have an organizing principal in Trump, what have Democrats got? Some organizing principles and not much else.With the possibility that Biden may be officially nominated in a glorified Zoom meeting instead of a convention, what does the Democratic Party do for him? It's broke, has no clout with voters and no way to enforce discipline on the politicians who constitute its upper echelons. Outside of ballot access it's kind of a joke. There's no establishment, so nothing gets established.The selling point of parties in the early days of the republic was that they would act as mediating institutions - protections against demagogues and the cults of personality that had been the demise of previous experiments in self-government. What's the selling point for the two parties now? Trump obviously gets the bad with the good here, though.His original formulation that it's up to governors to direct emergency responses in their states was not just more in keeping with the Constitution, but politically advantageous, as well.Under the new uber-executive construction, Trump will be deemed responsible for every mistake in either direction. He will have to backtrack from his position as bad outcomes present themselves. The routine will then give way to a guy who was just trying his best to help facilitate the real decision makers on the state and local level.But whatever he says, Trump will be removed or returned based on how the public perceives he performed in this pandemic and reversing the economic cratering he deemed necessary in order to fight it. Incumbency is a pass/fail test.But in the meantime, Biden will be a lion tamer in a cage with cats who know there are blanks in the pistol. \"It would be easy to show, if it were necessary, that no important power, delegated by the articles of Confederation, has been or can be executed by Congress, without recurring more or less to the doctrine of CONSTRUCTION or IMPLICATION.\" - : \"It was on this day in 1828 that 's was published.

Obama made the announcement in a statement and video posted on social media. 'Choosing Joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a close friend. And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now,' Obama said. Pointing to the severe challenges the nation faces as it copes with the coronavirus pandemic, the former president said that 'Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery.' ... And Obama stressed that Biden's a stronger presidential contender after surviving an historic primary field that peaked at some 25 White House hopefuls.\": \"Over the past year, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama practiced a political distancing of sorts... Then, in the weeks after it became clear that Mr. Biden was the party's near-certain nominee, Mr. Obama -- telling a friend he needed to \"accelerate the endgame\" -- had at least four long conversations with his former vice president's remaining rival, Senator . Mr. Obama's efforts to ease the senator out of the race played a significant role in his decision to end his bid and, on Monday, endorse Mr. Biden, according to people close to the Vermont independent. ... It is a negotiation between friends, but a delicate one. The terms of the reunion, however welcome, are complicated by an intermingling of political and personal issues...\": \"Based on conversations with multiple Biden advisers, allies and other influential Democrats, the former vice president has not tipped his hand about any specific individual. ... Some speculate that the twin health and economic crises could bolster the case for candidates on his short list like Massachusetts Sen. , or to a lesser extent Minnesota Sen. , who have Washington experience and demonstrated in the course of the Democratic primaries a fluency in the kinds of issues Biden would confront. ... California Sen. last week joined Biden for a virtual fundraiser. ... Another potential finalist, Michigan Gov. ... By month's end, Biden will formally announce the team to oversee that process...\": \"The top super PAC backing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is continuing to bombard President Donald Trump on the airwaves with a new ad set to start running in key battleground states on Tuesday targeting the president's coronavirus response. The new 30-second spot from Priorities USA, titled 'Front Lines' contrasts statements the president has made at White House press briefings and in Fox News interviews downplaying the need for certain resources amid the pandemic with clips of doctors and nurses sounding the alarm about supply shortages of personal protective equipment, such as masks and ventilators.\": \"If Biden can keep his current leads over Trump in general-election matchups, it could create opportunities for pickups of three big states -- Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. That's without hurting Dems' chances to take back Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the key wins that sent Trump to the White House in 2016. The Real Clear Politics national polling average shows that either Biden (+5.9%) or Sanders (+4.2%) would have been positioned to defeat Trump if the election were held today, but the role of the Electoral College means the results will come down to a handful of key states. Sanders' endorsement of Biden on Monday shows a quick turn toward unity for Democrats. In 2016, it took Sanders until July to endorse . It's still too early to know whether the coronavirus pandemic will make voters more or less likely to rally around Trump come November...\": \"The booming economy Trump hoped to ride to a second term is collapsing - with some forecasting a national unemployment rate as high as 30% - and the trifecta of states that delivered him the presidency will likely bear the brunt. Michigan, which Trump won in 2016 by 10,704 votes, now ranks just behind New York and New Jersey in the number of coronavirus deaths, with 1,479 fatalities as of Monday. Pennsylvania, which has the fourth-largest number of coronavirus cases, ranked first in the nation in percentage of new unemployment claims in the last two weeks of March. He carried the Keystone State by 44,292 votes in 2016.\"-: \"As Arizona residents endure a stay-at-home order and thousands of people suffer from coronavirus, President Donald Trump continues to fall in a head-to-head matchup with former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden has expanded his lead over Trump in the April edition of OHPI's Arizona Public Opinion Pulse (AZPOP), now leading the president 52 to 43 with 5 percent of voters undecided. This nine-point advantage for Biden is a sign the former vice president continues to gain traction in a historically ruby-red state. After a December poll showed Biden trailing the president, capping off a summer and autumn of decline for the vice president, he jumped to a six point lead in March and has increased that margin an additional three points in the month since.\": \"Biden leads Trump by 10 percentage points among likely voters in Virginia. When likely voters were asked how they would vote if the election were held today, 51% said Joe Biden, while 41% said Donald Trump. This represents an increase in support for Biden of 7 percentage points since our last reporting in December 2019. Gender and level of education are significant to the vote choice. Women prefer Joe Biden by 21 percentage points (57% Biden/36% Trump) and men prefer Trump by 4 percentage points (48% Trump/44% Biden).\": \"Democrats scored a significant victory in Wisconsin on Monday night when a liberal challenger upset a Trump-backed incumbent to win a State Supreme Court seat, a down-ballot race that illustrated strong turnout and vote-by-mail efforts in a presidential battleground state. The victory, by upward of 120,000 votes as of Monday night, came as a shock to Republicans and Democrats alike in Wisconsin, where contests for president, governor and the state's high court in the last four years have all been decided by about 30,000 votes or less. It followed weeks of Democratic anger over Republicans' insistence on holding elections amid the coronavirus pandemic. Wisconsin's map on Monday night looked like a dream general election result for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee -- stronger than typical for Democrats in the suburbs and a respectable showing among the state's blue-collar white voters in rural counties.

The governors say the measures they're taking to combat COVID-19 and slow its spread won't be effective unless they're all on the same page. But the president -- who had previously spoken of restarting the U.S. economy by Easter -- insists that he has the authority to open states' economies.

Trump, just days into his presidency, canned Yates from her job as the acting attorney general after she refused to defend the initial version of the president's executive order restricting travel into the United States from some Muslim-majority countries. Yates was in the position after initially being appointed the deputy attorney general by former President Obama.The version of the order that Yates refused to enforce was halted by a federal appeals court, but Trump later managed to get another version of the ban to pass Supreme Court muster.Yates later in 2017 testified in a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing in which she was grilled on her actions relating to the initial Trump travel ban that ended with her firing. In one exchange, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, cites a law that allows the president broad powers to control who goes in and out of the country.She responds by reading another law that bans discrimination in issuing visas and points out that the law she read was more recent than the one Cruz read. She also says she believed that the president's travel ban was unconstitutional anyways. The exchange with Cruz, who is known as one of the best orators and debaters in the U.S. Senate, launched Yates to folk-hero status among the liberals who single-mindedly oppose Trump, often called the \"resistance.\"Some conservatives have said Yates' interpretation of the law during the exchange was , but Yates nonetheless, because of that hearing, became an idol among much of the political left.A 2017 profile of Yates in the notes that Yates' father was a judge in Georgia and her grandfather, Joseph Dillard Quillian, was a member of the Georgia Supreme Court.Yates grandfather's official on the Georgia appeals courts' website gushes about Quillian's legal skills.\"He was a prodigious worker with an insatiable desire to follow the letter of the law in all opinions that he wrote or participated in,\" the biography says. \"His opinions 'are models of clarity from premise to conclusion, written with strict attention to pertinent fact and legal principle.'\"A native Georgian, Yates in an earlier part of her career worked in the Justice Department as a prosecutor in Georgia, and the case of Eric Rudolph, the man who bombed Olympic Centennial Olympic Park in 1996, and later several other locations, leading to three deaths.The case has recently grabbed headlines because of a 2019 Clint Eastwood movie titled \"Richard Jewell\" after the name of the security guard who was initially falsely implicated in the Olympic Park bombings by the FBI and the media -- accusations which turned his life and his family's life . Yates, well after the FBI had cleared Jewell, helped to put away Rudolph.Yates in February wrote a Washington Post op-ed arguing that the Trump administration is eroding the independence of the Justice Department, particularly through his handling of the case against Roger Stone, a former Trump campaign adviser who was recently sentenced to 40 months for witness tampering and other charges.Trump repeatedly called the Justice Department's treatment of Stone unfair in public, and higher-ups in the Justice Department at one point ordered the prosecutors on the Stone case to reduce their recommended sentence for Stone from 87-108 months in prison to 37-46 months. The government in its amended recommendations noted that the initial high recommendations factored in an alleged threat Stone made to a witness' dog, although the witness made clear he \"never in any way felt that Stone himself posed a direct physical threat to me or my dog.\"Four prosecutors who were involved in the initial recommendation resigned from the case -- and one from the Justice Department entirely -- over the changes.\"In response to the ensuing public firestorm, department leadership complained that the president's tweets were making things difficult for them, but it is the career prosecutors whom Trump continues to malign,\" . \"The Justice Department is not a tool of any president to be used for retribution or camouflage.

They don't want to see these small businesses go under because then all of a sudden you have a collapse of the fabric of our country and then you have all this extra debt so hopefully we can see the small businesses make it through this and the PPP as it's called, the Paycheck Protection Program, can get that extra $251 billion that the president's called for.\" Scalise went on to say that \"the Senate had a chance to get it done,\" but a \"list of demands\" from Democrats prevented that from happening. \"Hopefully we can get focused back on making sure this Paycheck Protection Program stays afloat, not just for the million businesses that already applied, but for the other maybe million businesses that are waiting to come,\" Scalise added.", "tags": ["fn-flash", "media", "americasnewsroom", "louisiana", "coronavirus"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 10:13:53", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 12:37:52"}

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the largest in the country, has suffered at least 59 deaths - twice as many COVID-19 fatalities as the NYPD and FDNY combined.\"We have been devastated by this virus,\" Interim MTA President Sarah Feinberg told Fox News. \"They are heroes, moving heroes. We're moving the essential workers who are fighting this crisis.\"New York City's bus and subway operators have been working 24 hours a day to transport doctors, nurses, and emergency responders to and from work during the pandemic, with little fanfare.However, just last week, employees reportedly began speaking out for the first time, criticizing the MTA of not acting sooner and doing more to protect them from the virus.The MTA insists it's taken industry-leading steps to protect the workforce and calls claims that its pandemic response was sluggish \"baseless.\" It is now instead blaming the CDC for issuing late face mask recommendations which caused confusion and delays endangering its workforce. \"We had a pandemic plan in place,\" Feinberg said. \"We are a responsible agency that took planning for something like this really seriously and we had supplies and we didn't distribute them early on because the medical experts told us not to.\"For months, the CDC advised Americans not to wear masks and only to wear a mask if ill. On April 3rd, the CDC changed its , citing new studies showing COVID-19 can be transmitted by asymptomatic people.The MTA says they began distributing masks a week before the CDC's decision.\"We finally threw our hands in the air,\" Feinberg said. \"Several days before the CDC changed their guidance, we went ahead and started distributing masks and gloves to our workers. And I think that was the right thing to do. In hindsight, I wish we'd done it even faster.\" The two unions representing the overwhelming majority of U.S. transit workers also wish the MTA had acted quicker.\"The truth of the matter is, if the MTA would have acted sooner, there would have been less fatalities,\" said John Samuelsen, international president of the Transport Workers Union of America. \"I think it's an absolute certainty that less transit workers would've died if the response in terms of proper protective equipment would have occurred earlier.\"The TWU and the Amalgamated Transit Union are working in tandem with public transit agencies to enact protective COVID-19 policies and the unions are pressuring the federal government to enact a uniform set of guidelines for public transit systems nationwide. There are more than 435,000 public transit workers in America and they all work for different transit agencies either run by the municipality or run by a contracted private vendor. Unlike the airline industry, there is no Federal Aviation Administration that can swiftly enact public transit guidelines.\"There has to be a federal standard that applies to all transit agencies across the country,\" Samuelsen told Fox News. \"Because otherwise there will be a lack of uniformity that will cost lives and spread the disease further.\"The unions are worried there is not enough personal protective equipment being distributed nationwide to adequately protect transit workers whose jobs involve moving large groups of people every day.\"Transit systems have been caught absolutely flat-footed. Pants around their ankles,\" Samuelsen said, \"in terms of providing a proper and safe workplace for transit workers.\"America's public transit systems with the largest ridership have generally cut the number of trains and buses in service, increased sanitation practices on all vehicles, are encouraging riders to wear face covers, and are requiring passengers to enter buses through the rear doors in an effort to protect bus operators.No state, however, has gone as far as enacting requirements as .Gov. signed an executive order requiring all personnel and customers on New Jersey Transit vehicles and other private carriers to wear face coverings, and it is limiting the capacity allowed on its buses and trains to 50 percent to ensure social distancing.In New York City, workers and customers are recommended to wear face coverings but they are not required. The city has also not issued a capacity requirement on buses and trains.The MTA has distributed nearly 750,000 surgical masks including 300,000 N95 masks, 50,000 small hand sanitizer bottles and millions of gloves. Employees are disinfecting more than 8,000 train cars and 5,000 buses nightly, requiring rear door boarding on buses by passengers, and eliminated hand to hand cash transactions on buses and at train stops.Every day and in every community, the coronavirus pandemic is bringing out the best in Americans. Take a look at some inspiring images of Americans pulling together in a time of crisis.The MTA has also deployed a \"temperature brigade\" checking about 2,000 employees a day and Feinberg said she wants to expand this, adding, \"I would like to see every single worker have their temperature taken before they show up for their shift.\"Some transit agencies in , , and , for instance, have instituted capacity guidelines -- giving bus operators the authority to skip stops if their buses are too full. The Chicago Transit Authority defines a crowded standard bus as 15 or more passengers and the SEPTA in Philadelphia has limited the number to 20.The Metro in has closed the first and last cars of all its trains and shut down about half of the Metro rail stations. has installed dividers to keep passengers out of the front rows of buses. has installed hand sanitizers on buses and trains.Fox News' Bryan Llenas spoke to workers who have lost their jobs and some who can't qualify for unemployment or haven't heard back yet.Transit unions are concerned transit systems are not providing enough PPE for workers. SEPTA recently secured 10,000 masks for its workers. This week King County Metro in state began giving out two fabric face coverings for their workers, and in , the MBTA began distributing masks last week.Feinberg believes the federal government should start a hero's compensation fund providing hazard pay for public transit workers and compensation for the families of public transit workers who have died from COVID-19.Among the MTA's 59 dead include Oliver Cyrus, a 20-year veteran MTA bus operator, and Warren Tucker, a five-year veteran bus maintenance worker.Described by his supervisor as a humble man, Cyrus \"did everything for his daughter Tamia.\" A creature of habit, Cyrus was the kind of colleague who would stop by every office, knocking on doors to say good morning and hello. Tucker was nicknamed \"Big Tuck\" and \"Big Dawg Tucks\" for his larger than life personality. Frequently wearing a flat brim Yankees hat, Tucker was hard to miss sitting atop the forklift at the Central Maintenance Facility. His supervisor said he was \"a great guy and will be missed by everyone that knew him.\"Unions theorize public transit workers in New York City are dying in higher numbers than other first responders because of the nature of the job. Transit workers are often older, work sedentary jobs, and breathe in chemicals all day from diesel to garbage in the subway.\"Transit workers are first responders,\" Feinberg said when asked about whether hundreds of transit workers nationwide could die from COVID-19. \"We continue to show up every day and do our job to move people during this crisis, and we are paying a heavy price.\"", "tags": ["coronavirus", "us", "transportation", "newyorkcity", "newyork", "losangeles", "texas", "massachusetts", "chicago", "washington", "washington"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 11:35:36", "modified_time": "2020-04-15 15:09:24"}

It was first introduced last year as the name of the 550 hp turbocharged 4.2-liter V8 engine in the now discontinued CT6-V sedan. The engine has been put on hiatus and won't be used in either of the new cars, which are track-focused models along the lines of a BMW M or Mercedes-AMG.Technical details have not been revealed, but both will be available with a manual transmission, which is becoming a rarity in the sports sedan segment.

And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now,\" Obama said.Pointing to the severe challenges the nation faces as it copes with the coronavirus pandemic, the former president said that \"Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. And I know he'll surround himself with good people - experts, scientists, military officials who actually know how to run the government and care about doing a good job running the government.\"And Obama stressed that Biden's a stronger presidential contender after surviving an historic primary field that peaked at some 25 White House hopefuls.\"Now Joe will be a better candidate for having run the gauntlet of primaries and caucuses alongside one of the most impressive Democratic fields ever. Each of our candidates were talented and decent, with a track record of accomplishment, smart ideas, and serious visions for the future,\" the former president noted.Biden, reacting to the backing of his former boss, tweeted: \"Barack -- This endorsement means the world to Jill and me. We're going to build on the progress we made together, and there's no one I'd rather have standing by my side.\"Obama's past reluctance to back Biden even as the former vice president came closer to the nomination had raised awkward questions about their relationship, but those close to the former president had suggested he was keeping his distance so as not to meddle in the primary process.President Trump's re-election campaign manager Brad Parscale argued that \"Barack Obama spent much of the last five years urging Joe Biden not to run for president out of fear that he would embarrass himself. Now that Biden is the only candidate left in the Democrat field, Obama has no other choice but to support him.\"A Democratic strategist close to Obama's inner circle told Fox News last week that \"at the beginning of the primary process, President Obama made clear that in order for the Democratic Party to be successful in November, Democratic voters would have to select their nominee.\"But now that Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee, Obama is entering the political ring anew.The source emphasized that the former president made it clear at the start of the primary process that once it was over, he would \"campaign vigorously in the general election.\"The video comes a day after Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was Biden's last remaining primary rival until he dropped out last week, officially endorsed the former vice president.The backing by Sanders -- the democratic socialist firebrand from Vermont -- will help Biden as he tries to win over Sanders' legions of younger and progressive supporters.Fox News confirmed recently that Obama and Biden have held several conversations in the past couple of weeks. And Biden gave details on one of those conversations - telling donors at a virtual fundraiser earlier this month that he had recently asked his old boss for advice on choosing a running mate. \"So I called President Obama, not as to who but how soon you have to start,\" the former vice president shared.The backing by Obama will also help Biden as he tries to unite a fractious party, as he prepares to challenge Trump in the general election. According to most recent polls of the former president, Obama remains extremely popular among Democrats. Obama, Biden, Sanders, and Democratic Party leaders are all trying to avoid a repeat of the 2016 election, when Sanders endorsed nominee Hillary Clinton in July of that year after a long and bitter primary battle. But plenty of his supporters either stood on the sidelines or voted for a different candidate in November, helping Trump to upset Clinton and win the White House.\"Now that the primary season is over, President Obama can play the role of unifier-in-chief within the Democratic Party,\" said Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor.Elleithee, a senior spokesman for 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee, said that Obama's also \"an important voice during these tumultuous times. As polling shows that President Trump's handling of this crisis is sliding, President Obama can help make the case for Joe Biden's very different approach.\"Obama's presence will likely also come in handy with fundraising and give a needed boost of energy to the Biden campaign.While political pundits agree that an active Obama can only help Biden as well as down-ballot candidates this autumn, in the end there's only so much a surrogate can do.

The only hurdle? Choosing a song.\"We kind of went back and forth, we were actually like singing songs for days, trying to find the right one to come up with.

President Trump describes himself as a wartime president, and I'd argue, that, like other wartime presidents, he should focus on the battlefield and not the politics.Some of the pressure is coming from public health experts who believe that the current approach is inefficient and should be more targeted at the most vulnerable (elderly) populations. But, also, there's significant pressure coming from conservatives who think that the should pay more attention to the economic impact of decisions to keep people at home.A reading of recent polls suggests that the president has significant leeway in delaying putting up an \"open for business\" sign. Indeed, of American registered voters believe the country is on the \"right direction\" in fighting the pandemic. Significant numbers support the financial assistance the government is providing businesses and families and the significant steps, e.g. closing down nonessential businesses, governments have put in place.Still, pressure continues to build on the president to relax measures and to enable businesses to re-open, sooner rather than later.In particular, Republicans may be concerned by a political science historical reality: the most important factor for an incumbent president is the economic growth in the second quarter. From April through June of an election, voters decide whether the economy is good enough to justify an incumbent's reelection.Republicans hope for signs of a clear economic upswing before voters bake in a negative judgment on the president's handling of the economy. Consistent with that, the president is seeking to set up an \"Opening Our Country Council\" in the next few days.President Trump argued that his decision on when to reopen the country will be \"the most important decision of his life.\" This is not an exaggeration.And, it's a decision for which polls today can offer little if any, guidance.Whatever decision he makes in the coming days will not be judged until September or October, at the earliest. Because of the COVID-19 crisis, people know why the economy is tanking -- and it's neither party's fault. Rather they want to see what happens during and after this crisis -- and only then will voters make their decisions.Just like other wartime presidents, he's not going to be judged by the initial popularity of the war, but by its effectiveness. In 2003, when President George W. Bush invaded Iraq, the war was very popular, and Americans welcomed his announcement of \"Mission Accomplished.\" By October 2004, the war was vastly more challenging. Bush likely would have lost that year, had Osama Bin Laden not released a video on the Friday before election day, reminding people of the stakes behind the \"War on Terror.\"It's not only Iraq. It's true for almost every war. It's not the polls. It's not the soundbites. It's the policy. During Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson was considered a favorite until the North Vietnamese appeared to score considerable victories during the Tet Offensive in 1968. Soon after, Johnson was humiliated in the New Hampshire primary and chose not to run for reelection.Similarly, in the initial stages of World War II, American successes were limited. In the 1942 off-year election, Democrats lost 47 seats in the House of Representatives and nine in the Senate, and Republican hopes for the White House in 1944 were high. But by the time of the election, D-day had occurred, as well as significant victories in the Pacific -- and Roosevelt sailed to victory.Even earlier, in the Civil War, continued Southern victories and the Northern body count through the summer of 1864 made most people (no polls available then) consider Abraham Lincoln a likely loser. It was not until September, with Sherman's victory in Atlanta, that the tide turned.The lesson for Trump: Beware of polls or pundits telling you in which direction to go: If you choose to reopen the country, and there's a huge second wave of infection in September, the same folks will blame you -- for following their advice. And if you choose to keep the country shut, and other economies start to boom, the same will occur.You make the decision: if it works, you win. If it doesn't, well, yes, you lose.The judgment that counts -- is the judgment voters make in November. They'll look back and decide whether the president took the right decisions in the face of an unseen enemy. They're willing to pay the price for now, so long as they see signs of victory at the end.As always, hindsight is 20-20, and in 2020 that hindsight will define the election.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "opinion", "donald-trump", "economy", "health", "politics"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 10:16:12", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 10:53:47"}

Former Tuscon police officer Brandon Tatum weighs in. has been continuing despite the shutdown of much of daily life due to the coronavirus -- with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announcing this week that more than 150 miles of new wall have been built.According to CBP statistics, 156 miles of new primary and secondary border wall system have been constructed since January 2017. Of that, 140 miles of primary and 11 miles of secondary wall replaces old or dilapidated wall. It means that there are a total of 656 miles of primary barriers and 42 miles of secondary barriers at the border when including those built before President Trump took office.A CBP official told Fox News last month that wall construction schedules have so far not been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.Two miles of primary wall and five miles of secondary wall are being installed at sites where there was no previous wall built. This stat is likely to continue to disappoint immigration hawks, who argue that almost the entirety of the border wall is replacing old structure, rather than plugging gaps in the border.Officials have noted that getting permission to build on private land is a lengthy process, but one that is starting to bear fruit, meaning that construction of more wall in places where no structure existed would start to accelerate.Additionally, the administration has pushed back on phrases such as \"replacement wall\" when it comes to describing the wall structure that is being built over old or dilapidated structures -- arguing that new structures are so radically different to count as \"new wall.\"Compared with the landing mat barriers in place, that could be easily driven or climbed over, the new 30-foot structures -- complete with cameras, anti-climb technology, access roads, lights and other tech -- are considerable upgrades.\"I use this analogy: when someone builds a new modern smart five-bedroom house in place of a dilapidated run-down shack, you do not call that a replacement house, you call that a new house,\" Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said in January.Much of the fight for the administration has centered on the question of funding -- but a series of efforts both in Congress and in the courts to allow the rechanneling of money from the Pentagon have paid off. CBP says that since 2017 it has identified a total of $15 billion to construct a total of 753 miles of border wall system, through a combination of Pentagon and Homeland Security funding, and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.CBP says that for fiscal 2020, an additional $1.3 billion has been awarded for 69 miles of new wall in the Laredo sector, also in areas where no previous barriers existed.There is another $6.3 billion earmarked from Pentagon counter-narcotics funding for approximately 306 miles, and an additional $3.6 billion from military construction funding for an additional 175 miles of construction.The administration has set the goal of 450 miles of wall constructed or under construction by the end of the year, as President Trump seeks to go into re-election being able to show that the wall he promised in 2016 is being built.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "politics", "border-wall", "immigration"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 09:56:38", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 10:50:46"}

Henry Stern and New York Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal this week teamed with animal protection legislative advocacy group Social Compassion in Legislation to roll out the plan for their states, which also would cut off imports of exotic and endangered wildlife that could spread \"zoonotic\" diseases like Stern and Rosenthal, both Democrats, proposed their legislation after groups of bipartisan lawmakers on Capitol Hill sent letters to the World Health Organization urging it to implement a global ban on live wildlife markets, and the Chinese ambassador to do the same in China.But these live animal markets don't just exist abroad--there are dozens in the United States.In New York City alone--most in the Bronx area--there are more than and slaughterhouses that sell and slaughter a variety of species for human consumption, including goats, sheep, chickens, guinea fowl, turkeys, partridges, rabbits, pigeons and quail, according to the lawmakers. At these markets, the animals are confined in small cages where experts say disease can easily spread--both to other animals and the people at the markets.\"Many live animal markets in New York are filthy places where neighbors complain about unbearable odors and blood and animal feces covering the surrounding public sidewalks and streets. These markets, where live animals are slaughtered on site and sold directly to the public, are breeding grounds for cruelty and disease,\" Rosenthal, who represents the district covering the Upper West Side and Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, told Fox News.Rosenthal said inspection reports of the facilities detail \"machinery used to kill animals that is caked with thick 'gunk' and staff who do not even follow basic sanitary standards, such as wearing gloves while handling dead animals.\"\"In addition to the well-documented cruelty to animals, unsanitary conditions like these endanger the health and safety of New Yorkers, and these markets must be closed down,\" Rosenthal told Fox News. \"The devastation wrought by COVID-19 should serve as a grim warning that live animal markets have no place in today's society.\"Meanwhile, in California, current law allows amphibians, reptiles and birds to be sold in live animal markets, which they define as retail food markets where, in the regular course of business, animals are stored alive and sold to consumers for the purpose of human consumption.Stern's bill would ban imports and sales of live wild animals that pose \"zoonotic\" disease transmission risk.\"We need to stop the brutal trade in exotic and endangered wildlife once and for all,\" Stern said in a statement. \"Whether it's a pangolin being sold for faulty medicine, a white bengal tiger being enslaved for entertainment, or a black rhino 'trophy' used to satisfy some misguided hunter's ego, California must put an end to wildlife trafficking.\"Despite the bills differing in specific detail, both Stern and Rosenthal agreed that New York and California could \"do better to protect public health and the animals trafficked in domestic and international markets.\"Social Compassion in Legislation (SCIL) also told Fox News that their organization is partnering with PETA and WildAid \"to help make this a global movement to end these markets.\"\"Time is of the essence to do away with the unacceptably cruel status quo which has cast a dark shadow over the entire world through COVID-19,\" SCIL founder and president Judie Mancuso said in a statement. \"As with our other sponsored legislation, California and New York can be models for the rest of the world.\"Wet markets have become controversial amid the pandemic. In a letter to the World Health Organization last week, Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Reps. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., Mike McCaul, R-Texas, and more than 50 other lawmakers called for a global shutdown of the markets, saying they \"are believed to be the source of the current COVID-19.\"They went on to note that scientists studying diseases that are zoonotic - meaning they jump between animals and humans - have pointed to the close proximity of shoppers, vendors and both live and dead animals at wet markets in countries around the world \"as prime transmission locations for these pathogens.\"They added that \"wet markets\" pose \"a threat to global public health because wildlife comes from many different locations without any standardized sanitary of health inspection processes.\"They also noted that scientists estimate that approximately 60-75 percent of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic and that approximately 72 percent originate from wildlife.The calls to ban wet markets come as the positive cases of COVID-19 globally hit nearly 2 million and saw more than 120,900 deaths.As of Tuesday morning, the United States reported more than 582,500 positive cases of the novel coronavirus and more than 23,600 deaths.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "politics", "newyork", "california", "china"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 09:53:43", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 10:32:17"}

Justin Amash, I-Mich., tweeted Monday night that he is considering a run as \"another option\" for Americans who are dissatisfied with leadership and also do not want to vote for presumptive Democratic nominee .Amash, who last summer refused to rule out a White House run in the immediate wake of his exit from the GOP, came into Congress riding the 2010 Tea Party wave and had long been one of the most libertarian members of the Republican Party. He left the GOP last year, saying in a op-ed that it was due to the polarized environment in Congress. But Amash had also long been one of the most critical Republicans of the president and later voted for both articles of impeachment against Trump passed by the House of Representatives last year.\"Americans who believe in limited government deserve another option,\" the Michigan lawmaker tweeted Monday in response to a quote from Trump on the president's \"total\" authority.A Twitter user responded to the post hoping Amash might be the other option, to which he responded that he was considering it.\"Thanks. I'm looking at it closely this week,\" Amash said.With Joe Biden already the Democrats' presumptive nominee and Trump having locked up enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, Amash's only option for a presidential run at this point would be as a third-party candidate.No candidate who was not a member of one of the two major parties has won a presidential election in modern American history, and Amash will almost certainly not be the first. Republicans overwhelmingly support the president and Democrats would be unlikely to vote for the congressman who was a member of the right wing of the GOP before he left the party.But an Amash candidacy would amount to one of the highest-profile third-party runs in modern history, given his position as a sitting member of Congress. If he manages to gain even marginal support from Republicans and independents who might otherwise vote for Trump but dislike his tone and leadership style, it could harm the president's chances in swing states that saw a razor-thin margin in 2016.Some Democrats still blame third-party candidates Jill Stein, of the Green Party, and Gary Johnson, a Libertarian, for Hillary Clinton's downfall in 2016 after multiple swing states were decided by just a few thousand votes.The last third-party candidate to garner significant support for a presidential campaign was Ross Perot, who ran in 1992 and 1996.

This decisive step has been credited with sparing millions of Americans from exposure to the virus, buying crucial time we needed to delay the wave of severe illness now familiarly known as the \"curve.\"It's been estimated that without any mitigation efforts by either state or federal governments, up to 2.2 million Americans would have died from COVID-19. President Trump's travel restrictions on China were joined subsequently by bans on travel from Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland, further limiting the introduction of the novel coronavirus from abroad.Concurrently the White House Coronavirus Task Force, first convened in January, developed guidelines for all Americans to follow while coordinating with state and local leaders to devise targeted responses to the distinctive situations faced in each part of the country.The task force's work has been informed consistently by evidence and scholarly analysis. From diagnostics and contact tracing to therapeutic interventions, to rates of hospitalization and mortality, data generated daily in ever greater quantity and diversity have yielded predictive models and guided both planning and action.Based on the best evidence and analysis to date, in mid-March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned that COVID-19 could kill up to 1.7 million people in the U.S. A model developed around the same time by the Council on Foreign Relations and Resolve to Save Lives predicted that between 163,500 and 1.6 million Americans could die from the pandemic, on the assumption that about 50 percent of our population would contract the disease.As President Trump has rightly noted, the death toll from COVID-19 is a figure that no one could ever be happy about. It is also true that every life spared as we \"crush the curve\" is a miracle worth celebratingTo maximize the nation's precautions against reaching such a peak on the coronavirus curve, President Trump and his team announced: \"15 days to slow the spread.\"By April 1, the aggressive multifaceted attack against COVID-19 at the federal and state levels had moved the worst-case predictions downward: the White House announced that the U.S. could expect between 100,000 and 240,000 coronavirus-related deaths by the end of the outbreak. Wisely, the president extended social distancing guidelines for another 30 days.Further progress was evinced on April 7, when projected mortality fell significantly in a widely respected model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), to between 49,431 and 136,401 American coronavirus deaths, with a median of just over 80,000. A day later the IHME's median was adjusted downward again, to about 60,000.The first couple of weeks of April have also demonstrated how rapidly our health care providers have adapted both outpatient and inpatient care according to clinical experience with COVID-19. Recent reports show coronavirus hospitalizations across the U.S. to be far lower than expected, with a notable days-long fall in new hospitalizations in New York, where the pandemic has struck hardest. The state now projects a need for roughly 20,000 to 30,000 beds, compared with the 110,000 that Gov. Andrew Cuomo had previously said would be needed.Regrettably, the president's critics seek to turn even unambiguously good news into something sinister: MSNBC host Chris Hayes, for example, floated the outlandish conspiracy theory that the administration had deliberately inflated previous counts to make the revised projections look better.Hayes' resoundingly ridiculed hypothesis is decisively refuted by experts, including Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, leaders of the Coronavirus Task Force, who have described how the nation's steadily evolving response to COVID-19, and the volume and speed of data collection, influence models' assumptions and predictions day by day.As President Trump has rightly noted, the death toll from COVID-19 is a figure that no one could ever be happy about. It is also true that every life spared as we \"crush the curve\" is a miracle worth celebrating -- as is the extraordinary partnership among government, enterprise and our citizens to fight a crisis of unprecedented magnitude and speed, an effort the president has led ever since news of the virus first emerged on the world scene.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "opinion", "donald-trump", "health", "infectdis"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 09:35:37", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 11:36:18"}

CNN, MSNBC and the three broadcast networks did not offer any on-air coverage or articles on their websites about the alleged assault. The New York Times and The Washington Post, two papers that dedicated extensive reporting to sex assault allegations made against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, were also mum on the matter.In addition, in seven televised interviews Biden has done since Reade came forward with her allegation, he was never asked about it. This includes three interviews on MSNBC, two appearances on CNN and appearances on the Sunday morning news shows on ABC and NBC. Prominent anchors like Anderson Cooper, Chuck Todd and George Stephanopoulos never questioned the presumptive Democratic nominee, instead focusing on the pandemic and President Trump's handling of the crisis.The absence of reporting from these outlets was notable enough for the satirical news site The Onion to address, mocking the Times on Thursday with the : \"'New York Times' Pledges To Cover Biden Sexual Assault Allegations in Upcoming Crossword.\"The tides began to shift following Rich McHugh's in Business Insider on Friday that Reade had filed a criminal complaint against Biden. The New York Times ran its first report about the allegation on Sunday morning as millions of Americans were observing Easter. The Washington Post and NBC News issued their own reports later that day.NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck blasted the \"slowness\" of the media's reporting on Reade's allegation and insisted that the timing of the recent reports was suspect.\"The liberal media's slowness has provided a whole new meaning to the term 'kicking and screaming,' because that's exactly how the press have approached Reade's story. Not only have they deceptively tried to sneak this in to coincide with Easter, but they've displayed shameful skepticism and even disgust when evaluating her,\" Houck told Fox News. \"Most disturbingly, the Times chose to allow the Biden campaign to edit their story, and it illustrated the depths to which the press will go to show that Biden is no Brett Kavanaugh.\" The Times raised eyebrows on Sunday after it deleted a tweet and tweaked its report about the 1993 accusation made by former Biden staffer Tara Reade, which originally read, \"No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade's allegation.

Both papers dedicated portions of their reports about Biden on previous allegations made against President Trump some considered \"irrelevant.\" Others slammed the newspapers for both noting the consequences of filing a false police report, which critics say fuel the perception of doubt in Reade's claims.Actress , one of the sexual assault victims of disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, took aim at the Post over its report on Reade.\"This is not journalism, this is an agenda. This is a hit piece. You've sunk to a new low in slanted journalism and victim shaming @WashingtonPost,\" McGowan tweeted.\"As a survivor, the way you launched into this woman's assault is truly vile,\" McGowan added. \"Your motto is 'Democracy Dies in Darkness' well I guess it's dead because you are dark. Evil lives and it loves the DNC.\"NBC News' report ran a peculiarly framed headline on its website, \"Woman broadens claims against Biden to include sexual assault.\" MSNBC aired its first segment about the allegation on Sunday evening during \"Kasie DC\" and a second segment on Monday during \"Meet The Press: Daily,\" which was cut short by the White House coronavirus press briefing.ABC News republished a report from The Associated Press on its website but did not address it on the network.Meanwhile, despite the partial dam that broke within the mainstream media, CNN and CBS News have yet to offer any coverage of the story both on-air and online, according to searches of their telecasts and Internet archives.CNN's chief media correspondent Brian Stelter, as the \"chief rapid response\" for the DNC over his weak coverage of media culpability, has been rather quiet about lack of coverage Reade has received and the criticism outlets like the Times and the Post have faced, only making a brief reference to the Baquet's remarks of the Times' reporting in his media industry newsletter Monday night.The Reason's senior editor Robby Soave wrote a piece in late March questioning why the mainstream media had avoided Reade's allegation for so long in comparison to its treatment of Kavanaugh, noting that the Times jumped on the leaked letter that was sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who later came forward as she was not identified in initial reports.\"Reade has already come forward. She has already identified herself and told her story. At this stage in the process of the Kavanaugh accusation's public reveal, the mainstream press was already actively covering it,\" Soave .He concluded, \"If the media's rule is this -- We're going to proceed extremely cautiously when revisiting unverified sexual misconduct allegations that are several decades years old -- then fine. But that's a new rule, isn't it?\"McHugh, who broke the story on Reade's filed criminal complaint against Biden, was formerly the producer at NBC News who teamed with Ronan Farrow to break the Harvey Weinstein scandal in 2017, which was ultimately killed by the network.\"After interviewing Tara on multiple occasions, I interviewed two of the people she told back in 1993 -- her friend and her younger brother. I found them both extremely credible and they corroborated her story to me. So when Tara filed a criminal complaint, and told me she was willing to go under oath, it was clear her claims needed to be reported. Simple as that,\" McHugh told Fox News.Former CNN producer-turned-media watcher Steve Krakauer noted in his Fourth Watch newsletter on Tuesday, \"I don 't know if Reade is telling the truth, just like I don't know if Kavanaugh's accusers were. But what I do know is the media coverage has been glaringly different. Do you know why? Me too.\"Reade initially stepped forward last year, when multiple women emerged claiming inappropriate touching by Biden. Reade, at the time, claimed Biden put his hands on her shoulders and rubbed his fingers up and down her neck, but the story got no traction aside from an .In late-March, Reade told a far more graphic account, with different and more serious details, raising the allegation to the level of sexual assault.Reade's story first resurfaced in an article in . Podcast host Katie Halper then interviewed Reade, who said that in 1993, a more senior member of Biden's staff asked her to bring the then-senator his gym bag near the Capitol building, which led to the encounter in question.\"He greeted me, he remembered my name, and then we were alone. It was the strangest thing,\" Reade told Halper. \"There was no like, exchange really. He just had me up against the wall.\"Reade said she tried to share her story last year, but nobody listened to her.

Gretchen Whitmer in the coronavirus crisis, it's all about power", "content": "Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer wants to be Joe Biden's vice presidential nominee and she's calculated that there's no penalty for petty authoritarianism.It takes courage and wisdom to see what's happening clearly and serve your people effectively. Most politicians are not capable of that. Here's a case in point.On March 23rd, , who is the governor of Michigan, announced it was going to be necessary to lock down her state during the and she explained why she was doing it. Here's what she said.Okay, so she said -- we want to be fair here -- what a lot of people were saying last month, which is, we need to slow the transmission of this so our health care system doesn't fall apart. As we just told you a moment ago, that's what the model said. Models had already factored in the lockdown.So, two weeks later, what's happened? Well, Michigan's health care system has not collapsed. Even in Detroit, which is as you likely know, has seen one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks anywhere in the nation.Many hospitals in Michigan are now discharging more coronavirus patients than they're admitting. In fact, an emergency hospital under construction outside Detroit has slashed its bed count from 1,000 to just 250. Why? The expected number of patients failed to arrive.Now, that's all great news that you would think Gov. Whitmer, who is supposed to be looking out for the interest of her own people, would be celebrating on television. She is doing just the opposite. She has moved aggressively to seize even more control of her state and the lives of the people who live there. So she bulled forward.Last week, , for any reason of any size, including in people's private homes, as if she is allowed to do that.If Michigan residents own more than one home, Whitmer has banned them from traveling between them, and outside Detroit, it is very common, especially for working-class people, to have a cabin up north. You're not allowed to go there.And then she kept going. Not only did Gov. Whitmer close most stores in the state, she banned the few that remained open from selling items that she deemed unnecessary.Gov. Whitmer wants to be the vice president. She wants to be chosen by Joe Biden. That's pretty clear, and she has calculated there is no penalty for petty authoritarianism.So where did this come from? How did Gov. Whitmer know that paint -- buying cans of paint --- could be deadly? How does not buying cans of paint prevent the spread of the coronavirus?Well, you'll notice we didn't play the whole clip. But if we did, you would have seen that Gov. Whitmer didn't bother to explain because she had no clue, because she didn't talk to anyone who'd studied it before she made the order. She could have consulted Hendrik Streeck.Streeck is a German professor who directs the Institute of Virology at the University of Bonn. He has done a lot of research on this, and based on it has concluded that actually, there's very little risk of spreading the coronavirus while shopping or actually even from touching surfaces, contrary to what they told you last month.Instead, Streeck found almost all the spread of the coronavirus came from \"people being closer together over a longer period of time.\" And that's the kind of behavior that maybe a mask might mitigate -- the ones they told you not to wear.And by the way, if that's true, then maybe you should think twice before you force people to remain indoors with one another all day, as Gov. Whitmer has.Now, has a slightly larger population than the state of Michigan and just like Michigan, it's a mix of larger cities and smaller towns. Sweden , in order to contain coronavirus. Yet, so far Sweden has fewer cases of coronavirus and fewer deaths than the state of Michigan does.Does the governor of Michigan know this? Does she care? No. That suggests it's about science, but it's not. And you know that by now. It's about power.Gov. Whitmer wants to be the vice president. She wants to be chosen by . That's pretty clear, and she has calculated there is no penalty for petty authoritarianism. In fact, petty authoritarianism might make even mediocre politicians look strong and decisive. That's her bet. She's willing to destroy the people in her state in exchange.And incidentally, when exactly did Gov. Whitmer becomes so deeply concerned about citizens dying and willing to do anything to prevent it? In 2018, Michigan had almost 2,800 deaths from overdose. It had another 1,500 suicides, more than that. Now, unlike coronavirus, every single one of those deaths might have been preventable.As it was, they fell disproportionately on the young and the middle age. And yet, Whitmer didn't shut anything down. She didn't even consider closing pharmacies dispensing this poison, asking police to conduct random searches to ferret out drugs and dealers. No. Nor did she say something about , which is sending all this crap into our country. Not a word.As for suicides, if she cared, she could have taken anyone in the state into custody at any time if that person was identified at risk of self-harm. But that wasn't a consideration, either.Then again, at the time, Joe Biden didn't need a running mate.

Several categories of people, however, will not be getting payments under the relief package. Here is a breakdown of who will be left out of this program.Any person listed as a dependent on someone else's taxes is not eligible for their own stimulus check. This includes both children and disabled or elderly adults whose own children may be claiming them as dependents.While the CARES Act allows parents to collect $500 for each child, that only applies to children 16 years old or younger. That means that dependents who are 17 or older do not qualify for this even if they are still in school, and if they do not file their own taxes they cannot get their own check.The CARES Act notes that non-resident aliens are not eligible for checks. Those with green cards as well as H-1B or H-2A work visas can collect stimulus checks. Others, such as temporary workers or illegal immigrants, are not eligible, regardless of whether or not they pay taxes.The stimulus checks are based on amounts of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for joint filers, but they decrease for those whose adjusted gross income surpasses certain thresholds. For individual filers, that mark is $75,000, for joint filers it is $150,000-- and for those filing as heads of household, it is $112,000. In those cases, the amount decreases by $5 for every $100 in income above those marks.This means the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more. For heads of household, the extent to which their payment decreases depends on how many children they have.The Treasury Department said that tens of millions of people will get their payments via direct deposit by April 15. Those who did not provide banking information with their 2018 or 2019 tax filings will either receive checks that will be mailed out before the end of April, or they can use an IRS online application that will be launching to allow people to provide information for direct deposit.Eligible people who do not file taxes will be able to enter bank information to get their money faster.The Treasury Department said they expect most Americans to get their money within the next two weeks.

{"url": ["https://www.foxnews.com/science/could-a-100-year-old-vaccine-protect-against-covid-19"], "title": "Could a 100-year-old vaccine protect against COVID-19?", "content": "Scientists around the world are racing to find ways out of the new . Some are working to develop new drugs and vaccines, while others are looking to see whether therapies we already have may help against COVID-19.In the latter category, researchers have dusted off one intriguing compound in our collective medicine cabinet -- a century-old vaccine to fight , a bacterial disease that affects the lungs. A couple of early analyses, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, have found that countries that require this vaccine, called Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), seemed to have been hit less severely, in terms of both number and severity, by the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.Could this vaccine be protecting people from COVID-19? The short answer is: We don't know. But several clinical trials around the world are now examining whether this vaccine could protect against this new foe.\"I was originally quite skeptical\" that the studies could tease apart all of the other factors that could be causing some countries to be hit harder with COVID-19 than others,\" said Paula Cannon, a distinguished professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, who is not a part of any of these studies. Among those factors are the quality of the healthcare system, measures put in place to fight the disease and testing capacity. Still, it is a \"provocative idea\" and the \"data is tantalizing,\" Cannon said.Dozens of countries, including Japan and China, require children -- typically newborns -- to receive the BCG vaccine as protection against tuberculosis, an infection that is typically more common in lower-income countries. Other countries, such as Spain, France and Switzerland, used to require the vaccine but stopped because the risk of catching the disease in those countries lessened, according to one of the preprint studies published in on March 28. Other countries, such as the U.S., Italy and the Netherlands never had such a universal vaccine policy for the BCG vaccine.But scientists have long known that \"almost by lucky accident,\" the BCG vaccine doesn't just protect against tuberculosis, it also helps fight other viruses, respiratory infections in particular, Cannon said. The vaccine, \"in some sort of unexpected and magical way, is like a broad immune booster,\" she said.For example, one study conducted in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa found that children who were vaccinated with BCG had about a 50% reduction in overall mortality, largely because the vaccine reduced respiratory infections and sepsis, or blood poisoning, according to the medRxiv study. Other studies, mostly conducted in animals, have found similar broad-spectrum protections from the BCG vaccine.The BCG vaccine is made up of weakened forms of live Mycobacterium bovis, closely related to the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. It was first developed in the 1920s in Paris and later shipped all over the world.Now, countries from Japan to Denmark have their own BCG vaccines, made using different formulations of live bacteria -- and each one has varying degrees of immune-boosting ability, said Dr. Ofer Levy, the director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children's Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School.Typically, live vaccines provide a \"strong and long-lasting immune response\" and sometimes even \"lifelong protection\" against the germ, whereas inactivated forms of vaccines, such as those in flu shots don't provide immunity that's \"as strong,\" .While most vaccines prompt one arm of the immune system -- the adaptive immune system -- to create antibodies that target very specific pathogens, the BCG vaccine taps into the other arm, the innate immune system. This system doesn't discriminate against pathogens and releases immune cells rather quickly to fight any foreign substance. The BCG vaccine thus boosts the body's production of non-specific immune cells.The medRxiv study and another preliminary study recently published in came to similar conclusions: there seemed to be a correlation between countries that require BCG vaccines and a reduced spread and severity of COVID-19 cases. For example, Portugal -- which has required BCG vaccines for infants -- has over 16,000 cases of COVID-19 but only 535 deaths whereas neighboring Spain has over 169,000 cases and over 17,000 deaths.Similarly, Ireland, with 9,655 cases and only 334 deaths, requires the BCG vaccination, whereas the U.K. with 89,554 cases and 11,346 deaths no longer does. Based on these numbers, Ireland has a fatality rate 3.5% whereas the U.K. has a fatality rate of 12.7%. Of course, there are big population number differences across these countries, along with other variables that could affect death and infection rates.These preliminary studies are \"very flawed,\" because many factors such as differences in wealth and testing ability, can affect the outcomes Levy told Live Science. But the authors are \"doing the best they can in a very difficult situation.\" While there's no direct evidence that BCG vaccines will reduce people's risk of developing COVID-19, \"I'm enthusiastic about the hypotheses,\" Levy said.It's difficult to draw firm conclusions, but there's enough scientific evidence to prompt clinical trials, and his team is looking into starting one in the U.S, he said. Clinical trials analyzing the protective effects of the vaccine against COVID-19 are already underway in other countries, including Australia and the Netherlands.\"I'm kind of puzzled,\" by the implication that the BCG vaccine might be able to protect for such a long period of time once someone has received it as a baby, Cannon said. Indeed, it's not clear how long the BCG vaccine effects can last.The second study, which also has not been peer-reviewed, analyzed how countries with re-vaccination policies -- or booster shots -- fared in the COVID-19 pandemic. That study found that countries without re-vaccination policies had a 5.2% case fatality rate, versus a0.6% case fatality rate in countries that required re-vaccination.\"The big kind of asterisk, if you like, against all of these studies, is that they are really dealing with massively incomplete information,\" Cannon said. \"We're all guessing what the true infection rates and the case fatality rates are because there isn't widespread uniform testing in every country.\"Still, \"I applaud the authors for at least, you know, doing what they could with the available data and providing some very provocative hypotheses,\" she said. \"The good news is they're very testable.\"In another world, we would be doing animal experiments to test this hypothesis. In this world, amid the coronavirus pandemic, we don't have time for that, she said. But the BCG vaccine has a \"very safe track record,\" and likely can be tried in those who aren't old and who don't have weakened immune systems (since this is a live vaccine, it can potentially cause more side effects for older people or those with weakened immune systems), she added.The human immune system is like an orchestra, \"it's massively interconnected and what the BCG vaccine seems to do is maybe it gives like a little bit of extra control to the conductor,\" Cannon said. \"So in the symphony of immune attack against respiratory viruses, the orchestra is able to go full blast, straightaway, all together, in sync, rather than kind of playing catch up.\"", "tags": ["coronavirus", "science"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 08:40:20", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 08:40:24"}

Unfortunately, that includes non-professionals doling out advice on social media sites like Facebook, or in forums like Reddit, which sometimes includes unfounded claims about Another bogus claim was the \"friend of a friend\" text chain about a national quarantine that was quickly debunked.The issue for Faust and others working to treat coronavirus is that the information being shared isn't necessarily held to a standard of proof. And he, like most doctors, still wants patients to get their advice straight from medical professionals.But there is another side to sharing medical information online that Faust and others say is actually helping to combat the COVID-19 virus in new and innovative ways: F.O.A.M., or Free Open-Access Medical education/instruction, which brings together medical experts seeking advice -- or offering their first-hand knowledge -- on how to battle coronavirus.Faust is one of the founders of the F.O.A.M. movement and co-hosts a podcast, FOAMcast, which now exclusively discusses coronavirus-related topics.Faust, whose background specializes in emergency medicine, regularly features other doctors of all specialties who are involved in the movement and have been working on COVID-19 research.\"Textbook knowledge is what medicine believed to be the case a couple of years ago. And journal knowledge ... is considered maybe what was thought to be a year ago, or six months ago, or a few months ago, when those were submitted and accepted. And F.O.A.M. and the movement [are] really what's happening now and, in the future,\" Faust said.Faust describes the movement as, \"a group of self-appointed people\" who have built a community over the last decade using various forums to share medical findings among a trusted group of medical professionals.Another member of the movement is Dr. Josh Farkas, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Vermont, and contributor to F.O.A.M. blog EMcrit. In mid-March, Farkas posted to his blog about using CPAP or continuous positive airway pressure machines to help patients breathe where hospitals are short on ventilators, a widely reported problem.Doctors from around the globe weighed in on Farkas' post confirming that they too had positive experiences using CPAP machines on coronavirus patients.The online platform has been critical to the rapid dissemination of information in this outbreak, especially so for doctors who are used to weeks or even months-long peer review process before publication.\"As we struggle with how to treat a disease that so recently was totally unknown, this rapid exchange and updating of information is crucial,\" Farkas told The Wall Street Journal of sharing coronavirus experiences over the Internet.\"We don't want to be in a situation where we have to wait years and years before we move the ball forward, especially in a moment like this,\" Faust said.Another F.O.A.M. colleague, Reuben Strayer, associate medical director of emergency medicine at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, and author of EmDoc, told The Wall Street Journal he couldn't imagine combating coronavirus in a pre-Internet world.\"How could you communicate about a disease nobody knows anything about that is marching across the planet?\" he told the news outlet.However, Faust urged caution about carefully weighing which information to trust.\"It's very easy to hear anecdotes of things working and not noticing that actually they don't work as well as we think they do, or they have some harms that we're not picking up,\" he said.Faust said one of the things he finds most promising about how the F.O.A.M. movement is being used to help with the coronavirus is that doctors are not only sharing positive news and innovations but also warning about things that have not worked or additional precautions needed.He pointed back to his colleague's CPAP discovery as an example.\"We learned early on, that in some cases, that intermediate step could be a little dangerous because it really makes droplets fly far in and out of the patients and could put health care workers at risk,\" he said.And as doctors navigate the front line against the novel coronavirus, they find themselves fighting a two-front battle: one against the virus itself, the other against the bureaucratic red tape of FDA approval.Doctors are making complicated risk calculations now more than ever and while their years of strenuous training and requirements have prepared them for this moment, even F.O.A.M.'s most invested, like Faust, said science remains the key.\"There's a difference between a great idea and a great idea that doesn't work. And that's that science tells us which of those things is which.\" Faust said. \"We've got to do this quickly, but we have to do it correctly. Otherwise, we actually could shoot ourselves in the foot\"", "tags": ["coronavirus", "health"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 15:26:35", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 17:37:33"}

{"url": ["https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-set-to-preside-spending-deficits-coronavirus"], "title": "Trump set to preside over record spending, deficits as coronavirus costs explode", "content": "Reaction and analysis from Peter Morici, University of Maryland business professor and former chief economist for the U.S. International Trade Commission., with the support of Congress, is poised to preside over an unprecedented explosion of government spending that already is set to shatter deficit records and could grow further if plans for more coronavirus relief bills -- nearing a potential total price tag of $5 trillion -- become reality.Even accounting for inflation, no modern administration has seen such levels of spending, covering everything to recession-era rescues in the early part of the Obama administration.The national debt itself already tops $24 trillion. As it stands, the 2020 deficit (the annual budget shortfall) is poised to break the record for a single-year deficit previously set under former as the U.S. government deals with the fallout from the pandemic, passing historically expensive economic stimulus bills in an effort to soften the blow of mandatory shutdowns for businesses and public life in general.Following the passage of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act late last month, Goldman Sachs has forecast that the federal deficit will reach $3.6 trillion for 2020, according to The . This is more than double the $1.4 trillion budget deficit the U.S. racked up in 2009, the highest one-year federal deficit in terms of gross dollars in U.S. history.Part of this was unavoidable for the president. Revenues will decline as the economy has tanked, and the $2.4 trillion worth of total coronavirus relief spending Trump has signed into law -- across three separate bills -- was widely seen as a necessary part of the federal government's response to a historic health and economic crisis. That spending may increase further as lawmakers and Trump seeking much more -- the president wants another $2 trillion package focused largely on infrastructure, and Democrats are seeking a separate $500 billion measure for small business, hospital and local government relief before that.All told, the total price tag could near $5 trillion if such measures are approved. Yet Trump, overseeing a humming economy for the first three years of his presidency, didn't use that time to reduce the federal deficit, but instead increased the pace of federal deficit spending. In the final two years of the Obama administration -- 2015 and 2016 -- the combined federal deficit was just under $1.03 trillion. The federal deficit was projected to be nearly $1.02 trillion in 2020 alone, according to the , before the coronavirus upended previous projections.\"When one thinks about deficits and their role in the economy ... fiscally responsible policies are bringing your deficit down during good times so that you have the fiscal space to borrow when there are emergencies like we have now,\" Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, told Fox News. \"What we've seen in the Trump administration has been a strong economy paired with very large deficit spending.\"She continued: \"So over the past years, we've had huge unpaid-for tax cuts and spending increases, and what this meant was we went into this emergency situation with our debt relative to the economy twice as high as it was when we went into the recession of 2008, for instance.\"Because changes like inflation, fluctuations in the economy and population growth make it difficult to compare government spending, debt and deficits over periods of time, the health of a government's debt or deficit is typically calculated as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP) -- a measure of an economy's size and therefore ability to pay off the debt it incurs.The federal deficit as a share of GDP in 2020 is likely to be the highest it has been since World War II, with a $3.6 trillion deficit making up approximately 15 percent of U.S. GDP.The federal deficit was almost 27 percent of GDP in 1943, or more than $50 billion, as the U.S. was in the middle of World War II under former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, according to the . Deficits swelled to 9.7 percent of GDP in 2009 as the Obama administration worked to dig the U.S. out of the Great Recession. The highest peak in the intervening time period was when the deficit reached 5.7 percent of GDP in 1983 as the Reagan administration cut taxes and ramped up military spending in an effort to defeat the Soviet Union. Deficits under Lyndon B. Johnson, whose \"Great Society\" programs included Medicare and Medicaid, never breached 3 percent of GDP, largely because the spending did not result from a crisis situation like World War II or the Great Recession, and the high costs of those programs were spread over many years.To MacGuineas' point, the current national debt -- more than $24 trillion -- is more than 100 percent of the GDP.\"This time we went into the downturn, deficits were already a trillion dollars, and again, it was the biggest deficit we've ever seen during a period of economic growth, so these are record-setting numbers in terms of how irresponsible we were before this crisis,\" MacGuineas said, noting that her post-coronavirus projections for the 2020 deficit put it closer to $3 trillion versus Goldman Sach's $3.6 trillion projection -- a number that would still shatter previous records.\"It means that structurally, the deficits will not return to manageable levels even when we're through this crisis, and it's going to make any recovery plan much more difficult because we're already borrowing so much, we don't know how much space there is to borrow more,\" she continued. \"It's left us incredibly vulnerable, and this is just kind of why you fix your roof when the sun is shining, because you don't want to be in such a dangerous and fiscally unmoored position as we are when this crisis is hitting us.\"The Trump administration, in its first three years, ramped up military spending and cut taxes, two priorities for the president that worked in conjunction to increase the deficit even as it made cuts elsewhere in the budget. The attitude toward the deficit under his administration is out of character for a Republican president, especially after Republicans of the early 2010s raised hell over increases in government spending during the Obama administration. That image of the party culminated in 2017 when former Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who throughout his political career was known as a deficit hawk, became House speaker. Ryan served alongside President Trump, however, who had little interest in cutting entitlements, which are the chief drivers of federal spending. He accepted that reality when he retired from Congress in 2018.\"I acknowledge plainly that my ambitions for entitlement reform have outpaced the political reality and I consider this our greatest unfinished business,\" Ryan said in his . \"Ultimately, solving this problem will require a greater degree of political will than exists today. I regret that.\"The increased deficits under Trump also conflict with comments then-candidate Trump made in 2016 in an interview with the Bob Woodward.\"I think I could to it fairly quickly,\" Trump said in response to a question from Woodward on paying off what was then a $19 trillion national debt.When Woodward asked Trump how long that would take, Trump responded, \"Well, I would say over a period of eight years,\" before explaining that he believed renegotiated trade deals could help eliminate the national debt.The Trump White House did not respond to a request for comment for this report. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on March 17, as Congress was working on its economic stimulus legislation that turned into the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, that the pandemic necessitated deficit spending in the near-term.\"Congress right now should be concerned about the American workers and small business, you know, interest rates are incredibly low, so there's very little cost of borrowing this money,\" he said. \"And as I've said -- in different times, we'll fix the deficit. ... This is the time, though, hardworking Americans are impacted by government decisions. That's when the government has to step up to put money into the economy.\"Romina Boccia, the president of the conservative Heritage Foundation's Grover M. Harmann Center for the Federal Budget, has that rapid-fire spending as the government works to dig out of the economic hole caused by the coronavirus could lead to even more consequences for the United States.\"There's the real risk, of course, that we might be teeing up a public debt crisis on the other end of this,\" Boccia said, which could lead to increased taxes, difficulties providing public services, inflation and economic stagnation.Of course, the economic pain the government is trying to alleviate is real -- with more than 16 million people filing for unemployment in recent weeks, a jarring figure. Lawmakers and the president are trying to not only cushion the blow from the shutdowns but prevent a broader economic collapse. Some of the appropriated money -- that going toward loans -- could also be paid back.Boccia has urged that lawmakers more specifically target relief programs to businesses and individuals that have actually lost money because of coronavirus-related shutdowns and rewrite the expansion of unemployment benefits that some lawmakers have decried because it could make it more lucrative for some workers to leave their current jobs than remain employed.All of this comes as lawmakers wrangle over potential further measures to combat the economic effects of the coronavirus. Republicans are asking for about $250 billion to immediately refresh the highly popular Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which gives loans to small businesses. Meanwhile, Democrats are pushing for approximately $500 billion to address the PPP, as well as other priorities.This is before Congress returns to Washington, D.C., in the coming weeks, when lawmakers have indicated they could potentially pass yet another coronavirus-related bill. Trump has said that he would like approximately $2 trillion in infrastructure spending in the bill while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said she wants at least $1 trillion in spending in what could be the fifth piece of legislation to combat the coronavirus.\"One of the things that I think really is a bit of a warning sign is that this isn't about topline numbers,\" MacGuineas said of the chatter on additional legislation. \"This isn't picking a number, especially one with a trillion at the end of it, out of the sky. It's instead really studying the dynamics in the economy, where things are proving to be resilient and where things are pockets of real weakness and building up from there how much we should be spending to stabilize the economy.\"She continued: \"I would argue there probably will be need for further measures and they will probably be quite large, but just tossing around one trillion and two trillion cavalierly without building it off specific needs that one sees worries me about the political process putting together a package like this... Just because it's the time for deficit spending, which it is, it's not the time for careless, poorly targeted or cavalier deficit spending.\"", "tags": ["donald-trump", "politics", "coronavirus", "deficit", "economy", "spending"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 04:34:15", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 08:33:29"}

It also reduces the conservative majority in the Wisconsin Supreme Court to 4-3 with another conservative seat coming up for reelection in 2023.Trump had called Kelly \"tough on crime\" and said he is doing a \"terrific job\" protecting the Second Amendment in one tweet endorsing the justice.\"He has my Complete Endorsement,\" Trump said in a tweet.Former Vice President Joe Biden won the Democratic presidential primary in Wisconsin, which was held before Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders exited the presidential race, making Biden the presumptive nominee.The Wisconsin election became a microcosm of a nationwide fight over mail-in ballots during the coronavirus crisis. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers lost in two consecutive legal challenges the day before the election as he attempted to move the date of the in-person election and to extend the deadline by which absentee ballots could be postmarked or turned in. Republicans in the legislature refused to work with Evers, a Democrat, saying that Evers did not come to them early enough, they had advocated for people to vote absentee anyways and people should have the option to vote in-person on election day. Republicans nationwide have expressed concerns over expanded mail-in ballot programs, saying they could lead to voter fraud, while Democrats see it as the best way to maintain social distancing while still conducting elections as scheduled.\"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and former Vice President say we must throw election integrity to the wayside in favor of an all-mail election, fundamentally changing how Americans vote in eight months,\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel wrote in an for Fox News. \"The overhaul would vastly expand opportunities for fraud and weaken confidence in our elections, but all Washington Democrats see is a potential benefit for their party.\"Biden last week emphasized in a \"Today\" show appearance that it's time to start looking into what it \"would take to have voting by mail.\"Karofsky, in a Monday tweet, said the move to force in-person voting by the conservative-majority Wisconsin Supreme Court was aimed at driving down turnout to help Republicans win.\"The last minute decisions made last week to hold in-person voting were designed to suppress votes and support a political agenda,\" she said. \"In-person voting should not have been held Tuesday.\"As the vote-by-mail push continues to gain momentum, Virginia Gov.

Instead, we saw Republicans willing to risk people's lives for their own political purposes, refusing to work with the governor to find an alternative solution to in-person voting last week.\"Kelly congratulated Karofsky in a statement and called it an honor to have served on the court.

Among them is one expectant mother - who is gravely concerned about medical resources - and an older man who has now run out of his heart medication, which is not accessible in Tonga. \"Two charters were sent to Tonga to recover a National Geographic film crew, and a Mormon family sent a jet for a missionary couple,\" Weeks said. \"No one has been in or out of Tonga since.

They are currently in California with their uncle waiting for our return.\" Lata stressed that their eldest has a seizure disorder \"and has had an increase in seizure activity due to lack of sleep, loss of appetite, and stress of being away from home and worrying about (her parents).\"\"My husband is a Chef at a retirement home, and I am a Registered nurse for our local hospital in Salem, Oregon,\" she continued. \"We need to get home to our family and back to work to assist our co-workers currently on the frontlines caring for those directly affected by COVID-19.\"\"Most of these travelers are already two to three weeks past their expected stay, have run out of money, have no way home, and have families looking for their security and support during such an uncertain time here in the US where they belong,\" Weeks, who has been helping to take care of the Tongamoa family in Georgia, lamented.Salesi Tongamoa, 36, who works two jobs in his hometown of Marietta - in junk removal and in bar management - to support his young family had traveled to Tonga at the beginning of March to lay his father to rest. As the pandemic began its sudden escalation, he moved his flight to the earliest available - informed it was March 21.The airline said there should not be a problem, Tongamoa recalled, but on arrival he was told by airport workers that he was not even permitted to go inside. \"There are no options at this moment, we aren't being told anything,\" he underscored, reflecting on his three children aged 10, 6 and 1. \"My wife has been taking care of them and worry if I will ever hold my family again. This is my world. If any of them get sick, and something happens, I don't know if I can ever live knowing I am miles and miles away and helpless.\"But finances too are fast faltering, Tongamoa said.Some of the stranded Americans told Fox News that they were given a sliver of hope earlier this month, when they received a notification from the Embassy in Fiji about a flight out of Fiji to New Zealand on April 13 and were urged to quickly book a seat as the seating was limited. But the hope turned out to be a false one, some opined, and were informed the flight was for New Zealand passport holders only. Then there is Salote Kalilea Grewe, 37, a dispatcher from Antioch, Calif., who also emphasized that he was not informed his flight was halted until three hours prior to takeoff.\"It is so important for me to get home I have four children that have no mother in America, and all of them are under the age of 16,\" he said. \"Every day is a struggle to see them through messenger, trying to hide the feelings of giving up from them. The truth is I give up every day but when I see their faces on messenger it gives me hope.\"Grewe added: \"I would do anything just to hold them again. I've been away from them for a whole month and it is eating me up inside that I can't do anything to see my babies again.\"If anyone out there that can hear me please help me to get home to my babies. I just want to hold my babies again.\"The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, the department cautions on its travel advisory, published on March 31st and almost two weeks after the Tonga shutdown, that U.S. citizens who live abroad should all international travel.On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took to Twitter to praise the coordinated efforts of U.S. embassies and consulates around the globe in bringing some 700 Americans home amid the devastating pandemic.", "tags": ["whitehouse", "world", "us", "health", "coronavirus", "statedept", "donald-trump"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 17:00:32", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 07:28:00"}

Now, like hundreds of millions of other households, we have more family time than we ever imagined. Despite the challenges, stress and fear, I am grateful for this family time.One significant challenge has been maintaining our children's education. Attempting to achieve this has not all been smooth sailing. One Israeli mother of four to Instagram to vent her frustration over homeschooling her children during the crisis, striking a chord with parents across the world.\"It's not working, this distance-learning thing. Seriously, it's impossible!\" said Shiri Kenigsberg Levi, a special needs teacher from Ashkelon, in an entertaining , later translated into 20 languages. \"All day it's, 'How's the child feeling?' How's the child feeling? He's spending the entire day on his cellphone -- he's fine! Sleeping fine, eating fine -- they won't stop eating. How's he feeling?! Ask me how I'm feeling! I'm falling to pieces!\"Many parents (my wife and I included) relate to that sentiment. We have six children ranging from a third grader to three college students, all studying at home, plus two parents remote-working full time. We are not alone. The transformation has been global, and it happened almost overnight.Schools and universities may be shut down physically, but they have been admirably transformed thanks to the technology of distance learning. In the 2020 phrasebook, \"distance learning\" will be up there alongside \"social distancing\" and \"flatten the curve.\"Many of the tools being used barely existed a decade ago. In real-time, we have seen how tech can move fast and fix things, and continue to adapt as circumstances demand.My children's schools stepped up to the plate impressively, quickly and professionally. They are smoothening out the kinks as they go along. The classes are interesting and keeping the kids busy. The kids have adapted quickly and are (generally) content to log on for their studies.At first, we were a little overwhelmed. It was incredibly demanding. The schools didn't necessarily factor in that in many households both parents are still fortunate to be working. We are also busy performing new time-consuming chores to reduce the risk of infection, such as unpacking deliveries outside the house, wiping down each item in the packages and constantly wiping down high-touch surfaces. We had to help the younger kids fix the glitches and adjust the workload - it was too much at first. But the schools were very responsive and flexible.This crisis is likely to change education forever, just as it has transformed business and other areas of the economy and society. New methods developed on the fly during these transformational times will stay with us.We must work together to ensure that today's education challenges won't interfere with the education of all of our children, and bring comprehensive distance learning closer to all.Unfortunately, many are excluded from this global transformation. My family is fortunate. We have enough devices, physical space and Internet access to embrace the change. Many others are not so lucky. Here in the U.S., there are thousands of students and teachers without these resources.Technology leaders have stepped in to sustain the huge switch in business practice. Hopefully, they will also step in to address education needs. How can we provide all teachers and all students with adequate iIternet access, equipment and software so that if this new world continues much longer, or the next time there's a pandemic or other crisis, everybody is treated as equally as possible?I recognize that education is never going to be perfectly equal for everyone, and certainly not under these crisis conditions. However, we must recognize that we need to be prepared for a future where this is not a one-time issue. We must work together to ensure that today's education challenges won't interfere with the education of all of our children, and bring comprehensive distance learning closer to all.I wish a speedy recovery to all who are suffering from COVID-19 and strength to their loved ones and the heroes who are taking care of the ill and all of us who are at home.

Purposely or not, by praising China's to a virus the WHO first denied and then lied about, this longtime paragon of public health is fueling a \"China versus the world\" showdown.Against every shred of science, virology and common sense, China still claims the COVID-19 outbreak there was isolated to , that while it ravages the rest of the planet, there hasn't been a single case reported just down the road in its political and merchant centers, Shanghai and Beijing.China's brazen conduct has been both calculated and purposeful, and the ascending clamor for investigation and punishment can't come quickly enough for national economies that have been devastated, and innocent lives - including a newborn baby - that have been eliminated.By enabling Chinese misconduct, the WHO has become the new poster child for international organizations so bloated with bureaucracy and punctuated by politics they've turned into something well beyond what they were intended to be.Created within the United Nations in 1948 by Chinese diplomat Szeming Sze and (accused Russian spy) Alger Hiss, the WHO (in line with its predecessor, the International Sanitary Conference) was charged with monitoring and coordinating emergency response to global health threats without regard for race, gender or nationality. One world, no borders.After early successes confronting malaria, smallpox and polio, the WHO's response to Ebola six years ago was tragically tardy (thousands died before the organization declared it an emergency) and its delay in sounding the alarm over the COVID-19 calamity (rejecting travel bans and its human-to-human transmission) is inexplicable.Today, the WHO is led by the first non-doctor in its history, Ethiopia's Tedros Adhanom, whose fealty to Marxism, and appointment of Robert Mugabe as his \"goodwill ambassador\" (the Zimbabwe zealot who ravaged his nation through corruption and crimes against humanity) are more than feckless footnotes to his public health career.More troubling, under Tedros' leadership, WHO is morphing from vox populi neutrality to a more combative defense of its policies, decisions and players. Instead of employing a more dispassionate, just-the-facts approach to its mission, WHO - like Tedros did when he won the directorship - is now campaigning to score points, as if public health is a game to be won by some over others.Growing distrust of institutions, which already stops us from cooperating on the small stuff, has now infected initiatives needed to secure the world against challenges that honor no history or national border. For the sake of the world, the WHO should quickly shed its defiant rhetoric and return to its original mission as the early-warning system for pandemics, epidemics and health scares, where information is shared openly, completely and without interpretive bias. If not, they must be replaced by an organization that will.Globalist maven Henry Kissinger is already calling for a new post-pandemic world order based on \"public trust,\" but that's the rub. How do you create enough trust to forge alliances of common interest across the globe when nationalism is on the rise, institutions are in decline and those who know what they're talking about are left to watch from the sideline?Growing distrust of institutions, which already stops us from cooperating on the small stuff, has now infected initiatives needed to secure the world against challenges that honor no history or national border. While respondents in a recent Gallup survey regarded doctors and scientists as the most trusted (94 percent and 86 percent, respectively), only 9 percent expressed any real trust in government, and by extension, any government organizations, to measure up.More frighteningly for the indefatigable Dr. Anthony Fauci (and for all of us), the same Gallup survey revealed that one out of three Americans (and near majorities in France and Switzerland) feel life-saving vaccines are life-threatening, and they may resist using them when they become available.In public health, the remedy begins by compelling the most important organizations to focus on what they know and do best while leaving behind the rest. For America's Centers for Disease Control (CDC), for example, that means issuing health-related travel alerts and disease transmission data, not dictating public policy on gun control (as the agency did in 2015).Similarly, the WHO (with or without Tedros) should return to its historical mission as the world's \"canary in the coal mine,\" warning the world when danger is headed its way. If it does not, once the pandemic is in our rearview mirror, we should replace the WHO with an organization that will do so, and that will give the world not always what it wants to know, but what it needs to know.Our survival depends on it.

After more than seven collective decades of service in uniform, we have seen time and again that when retreats, the threats worsen and always find their way to our shores.Whether combating ISIS, Ebola or , the winning American strategy is the same: U.S. leadership to build global coalitions, targeted investments in foreign assistance, and sustained diplomatic and political will to see the fight through.Our survival in an interconnected world now rests on whether we make the investments and rally the world to stop COVID-19. Even if we flatten the curve here at home in the short term, our failure to stop the spread among some of the most vulnerable in our world - often in densely packed housing and refugee camps without clean water - will lead to a new global surge that will land right back at our doorstep.This is a fight where our civilian and public health professionals must lead the way to keep Americans safe. Working on the front lines around the world, the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have the experience, platforms and relationships to stop this pandemic, which not only threatens our homeland but all our military personnel stationed around the world.As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said recently, \"Through decades of U.S. global leadership in health and humanitarian assistance, we know that smart and strategic investments have proven critical to protecting the homeland.

He told the White House press corps, \"We have to keep doing that, that's humanity you're talking about\" adding that on COVID-19, the U.S. will likely end up \"economically doing something for other countries.\"The president's suggestion is exactly right - and doing so is directly in our own nation's health and economic interests.We worry that if we don't match our resources to the global scale of this challenge that the sacrifices of all Americans in these difficult times will be in vain. As the administration and Congress consider additional emergency funding to protect Americans' lives and well-being, the imperative has never been greater to meet this challenge with the full arsenal of America's global health, humanitarian and economic toolkit. The simple truth is we can pay now or we will pay later.When COVID-19 can travel from a remote village anywhere in the world to the U.S. in just 36 hours, this is one campaign that we cannot and must not try to do on the cheap. Instead, we will only be successful in confronting this threat by fully investing in strengthening the weak health systems, disease surveillance and prevention strategies necessary to blunt and ultimately stop the coming surge in some of the poorest places in the world - and address the humanitarian and economic consequences of the pandemic.As we watch China try to exploit a crisis they couldn't contain to their own gain, we know that if America doesn't lead, others will try to step into the void that we have left.We salute the sacrifices and risks taken by our first responders, medical personnel, Reservists and National Guard fighting this disease at home.

{"url": ["https://www.foxnews.com/science/do-face-masks-really-reduce-coronavirus-spread-experts-have-mixed-answers"], "title": "Do face masks really reduce coronavirus spread? Experts have mixed answers", "content": "For the first time, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that even seemingly healthy people wear masks over their mouths and noses when venturing out of their homes into places where it is difficult to maintain distance from other people. But there is still major debate over how much masks -- particularly the that the CDC recommends for the public -- can slow , the virus that causes COVID-19.Researchers, writing in two new papers, attempt to tackle the efficacy of masks, one more rigorously than the other, and come to differing conclusions. One study examined the effect of masks on (which cause many cases of the common cold) and found that surgical masks are helpful at reducing how much virus a sick person spreads. The other looked particularly at SARS-CoV-2 and found no effect of either surgical or fabric masks on reducing virus spread, but only had four participants and used a crude measure of viral spread.The bottom line, experts say, is that masks might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly passing along the virus. But the evidence for the efficacy of surgical or homemade masks is limited, and masks aren't the most important protection against the coronavirus.Related: \"Putting a face mask on does not mean that you stop the other practices,\" said May Chu, a clinical professor in epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health on the Anschutz Medical Campus who was not involved in either new study. \"It does not mean you get closer to people, it does not mean you don't have to wash your hands as often and you can touch your face. All of that still is in place, this is just an add-on.\"Recommendations about masks can easily get confusing, because all masks are not made equal. The N95 mask effectively prevents viral spread. These masks, when properly fitted, seal closely to the face and filter out 95% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. But N95 masks are in serious shortage even for medical professionals, who are exposed to the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 and are most in need of the strongest protection against the virus. They're also difficult to fit correctly. For those reasons, the CDC does not recommend them for general use.Due to shortages, the CDC also does not recommend surgical masks for the general public. These masks don't seal against the face but do include non-woven polypropylene layers that are moisture resistant. In a surgical mask, about 70% of the outside air moves through the mask and about 30% travels around the sides, Chu told Live Science. For that reason, they don't offer as much protection as N95s.That leaves fabric masks, which currently are recommended for general use by the CDC. Fabric masks also allow air in around the sides, but lack non-woven, moisture-repelling layers. They impede only about 2% of airflow in, Chu said.All of this leakage in surgical and fabric masks are why public health officials generally don't believe that wearing a mask prevents anyone from catching a virus that is already floating around in the environment. Airflow follows the path of least resistance, said Rachael Jones, an associate professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who was not involved in the new research. If viral particles are nearby, they have an easy path around a surgical or fabric mask. And in the case of a fabric mask, wearers may well be wafting in particles small enough to flow right through the fabric.But what about the other way around? When the wearer of a mask coughs or sneezes, the barrier might be enough to contain a lot of that initial jet of grossness -- even if there are gaps in the fabric or around the sides. That's what the new mask studies aimed to address: Whether surgical or fabric masks did a good job of containing viruses.CORONAVIRUS SCIENCE AND NEWS--------------One study, published April 6 in the journal , found that they did not. That study, led by South Korean researchers, involved asking four patients with COVID-19 to cough into a petri dish 7.8 inches (20 centimeters) away. The patients coughed without masks, while wearing a disposable surgical mask and again wearing a 100% cotton mask.Neither mask meaningfully decreased the viral load coughed onto the petri dishes. But experts not involved in the study who were contacted by Live Science were hesitant to put much stock into the findings. The researchers didn't look at distances beyond 7.8 inches to see if droplets didn't travel as far while people were wearing masks, Chu said.\"They didn't measure 2 feet or 3 feet or 4 feet,\" she said.Related: The study also returned the odd result that most swabs from the outside of patient masks were positive for coronavirus and most from the inside were negative. The authors speculate that perhaps turbulent jets of air from coughing carried the virus toward the outside of the mask, but the explanation wasn't very satisfying, according to Jones.The other study, published April 3 in the journal, used a more sophisticated method of collecting the virus particles that sick people emit. The researchers asked 426 volunteers to breathe for 30 minutes into a cone-like device that captures everything exhaled. Of these, 43 patients had influenza, 54 patients had rhinoviruses and 17 patients had seasonal coronaviruses (the kinds that cause colds, not the kind that causes COVID-19). This method allowed the researchers to quantify how much virus was found in droplet particles, which are greater than 0.0002 inches (5 microns) in diameter, versus aerosol particles, which are 5 microns or smaller. The participants were randomized to either wear a surgical mask or not wear a mask during the study.AdvertisementSponsoredLearn how to supercharge your content with Magento Page Builder! Easy drag & drop solution eliminates manual website coding.LEARN MOREThe first key finding was that the researchers detected virus in tiny aerosol particles in all cases: influenza, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. In the case of influenza, they cultured the captured particles and discovered that they were infectious. That's important, said study author Ben Cowling, head of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at The Hong Kong University, because there is a long-running debate among health professionals about whether influenza can spread via aerosols. The study suggests that it likely can, and that colds probably can too.\"For seasonal coronavirus and rhinovirus, we didn't attempt to culture the virus in the aerosols, but there is no reason to believe that the virus would not be infectious,\" Cowling told Live Science.And as for masks? Surgical masks reduced the amount of virus released from a sick person in the form of droplets but not aerosols for ; the masks reduced coronavirus in both droplets and aerosols; and they didn't reduce either in rhinovirus. For the seasonal coronavirus, researchers found the virus in droplets in 3 out of 10 samples from participants not wearing masks and in aerosols in 4 out of 10 samples taken without masks. In samples taken with masks, no virus was detected in either droplets or aerosols.The difference between viruses could have something to do with where in the these infectious invaders make their homes, said Cowling, who is also co-director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control. For example, a virus that reproduces deep in the lungs might need to travel in smaller particles to make it all the way out into the world, while one that reproduces mostly in the nose and throat may be more easily mobilized in bigger droplets.The results from influenza and seasonal coronaviruses suggest that surgical masks can help keep people with COVID-19 from spreading the virus, Cowling said. SARS-CoV-2 probably behaves similarly to the viruses he and his team studied, he said, and the fact that people can spread the virus before they experience symptoms is an argument for recommending masks for everyone.But experts are still mixed on the potential usefulness of non-N95 masks.\"To me, it's not harmful to wear these masks, but it doesn't look from this study like there is a whole lot of benefit,\" Jones said. The sample size for seasonal coronavirus was small, she said, and there was a large amount of non-mask-related variation in how much virus people emitted, particularly given that the majority of samples without masks didn't have detectable coronavirus.One thing everyone does agree on is that, whatever containment provided by non-fitted masks do provide, homemade fabric masks are the least effective. The recommendations that everyone wear masks are because \"any kind of impediment is better than nothing,\" Chu said. But fabric masks are not expected to be as protective as surgical masks, she said. That's why public health officials are warning people to remain at least 6 feet apart from one another, even if they are wearing masks. In other words, homemade masks are likely to be just a small piece of the puzzle for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.\"There's been enough research done to be able to confidently say that masks wouldn't be able to stop the spread of infection, that they would only have a small effect on transmission,\" Cowling said. \"We shouldn't be relying on masks to help us go back to normal.\"", "tags": ["coronavirus", "science"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 08:33:33", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 05:30:35"}

Brian Mast: Coronavirus -- Speaker Pelosi, Americans risking it all on the job, Congress should work too", "content": "Nurses from Kansas City, Missouri are volunteering to help medical staff at Tulane Medical Center in Louisiana.My life was spent as a who volunteered to disarm bombs. I chose that profession because I knew I would have a real chance to save the lives of my friends, even if it would put my own life at risk to do it.In many ways, my job was to be the tip of the spear in the War on Terror. I serve in today for the same reason: to defend my country and help protect the people in my community.The United States is currently faced with a different kind of war against an , and Congress must be the tip of the spear in this battle.However, in this moment where our country needs strong leadership the most, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has instead made Congress AWOL. She has wrongly assessed that the personal risk to members of Congress is too great for us to go to work. The truth is, for true defenders of America, there can be no such thing as a risk too great.Congress has been out of session -- not even debating new ways to help Americans -- for weeks. The message to citizens of the United States is clear: our country's leaders will not make the same kind of personal sacrifices to keep our country running that grocery workers, food service staff, truckers, delivery drivers, bankers, doctors, nurses, first responders and our military are willing to make.Passing the CARES Act to address the effects of the coronavirus crisis was a good start, but it was just that: a start. When I was serving in the Army, quite often after capturing terrorists, their immediate interrogation would lead to follow-on missions that had not been originally planned. We did not take a month off and pat ourselves on the back. Instead, we kept up the fight.Congress should now be conducting follow-on missions to the CARES Act. Americans watched with justified disgust during the negotiations leading to the CARES Act as some in Congress prioritized their pet projects, such as funding the Kennedy Center, which in turn laid off its employees anyway. We should be taking these misspent dollars and using them to support hospitals, provide additional relief for families and ensure a stronger lifeline for small businesses. We should also be addressing problems that were not fully understood when the bill was first passed.None of this is happening right now. In fact, in my few years in Congress, I have yet to see everyone put their differences aside and pull together for the American people. If not now, then when? The House and the Senate -- Republicans and Democrats -- need to be in one place: sleeves pulled up, whiteboards out, working each issue as it arises in real time -- not days or weeks later on compartmentalized conference calls.The bottom line is that Congress needs to work with a level of urgency that matches the unprecedented crisis our communities are facing.I understand that there are risks associated with Congress being in session, but Congress cannot do its job if members don't show up for fear of getting hurt.My job in the military was to disarm bombs in the dark of night in a country littered with improvised explosive devices all while hunting the kind of murderous terrorists that believed in a divine calling to kill Americans. Inherently, this was unsafe, but we still did our job because we had a mission to accomplish. What mattered most was ensuring that our fellow citizens were kept safe. That's why, night after night, we continued to load onto CH-47 Chinook helicopters knowing someone was going to try to kill us when we landed.The bottom line is that Congress needs to work with a level of urgency that matches the unprecedented crisis our communities are facing. Never before has America asked Americans to not go to work. As a result, one extra day without an assistance check can mean the worker who is laid off cannot get groceries. Another 36 hours without a loan for some small business owners who spent decades building the American dream may mean they never open their doors again.For our health care workers who are reusing masks, waiting 48 hours more without a resupply of protective equipment can mean infected hospital staff. Many students who were sent home from university cannot find work but will also not receive the $1,200 assistance most others will get. Support has been jeopardized for individuals who made a mistake in their past and have served their time, coming out stronger on the other end.Americans who want nothing more than the purpose and wages of their work are having their livelihoods stripped from them through no fault of their own.Here's my call to action: Congress must get back to work.If Speaker Pelosi needs to borrow my mothballed protective gear and gas mask to gavel the House into order, so be it. There is work to do and a mission to accomplish. The fearful arm's-length approach that she is currently using dishonors the sacrifice of all Americans on the front lines of this pandemic.I am not suggesting that the risks associated with keeping Congress in session can be eliminated, but I do know it is worth the risk.An improvised explosive device detonated beneath my feet on Sept. 19, 2010. When that bomb went off, I lost both my legs, and I nearly lost my left arm. Pelosi may read my story and decide that the lesson is that the risk was too high -- the mission that night wasn't worth it. But the mission was absolutely worth it. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.The scars on my body from that night are my daily reminders that we all still have a job to do. Personally, I would rather succumb to the ails of COVID-19 than fail to serve when I asked and was chosen to do so. Speaker Pelosi, this is no time for cowardice. Congress needs to set an example for our country about what it means to be the tip of the spear. Let's accomplish this together to show that America can get back to work with the risks mitigated as best as they can, but no matter what, the job for all of us will continue to get done.", "tags": ["coronavirus", "opinion", "congress", "health", "infectdis"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 16:26:59", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 05:00:01"}

The list of top-quality shows with addictive human drama is bafflingly long, which means there's a lot to catch up on. Fortunately for indecisive viewers, Hulu offers most of TV's best dramatic shows along with a handful of originals that people can't seem to stop talking about.However, there's a lot on the streaming platform to choose from. So, if you feel like you've seen it all and are still looking for your next dramatic show to tackle, below is a rundown of the Top 5 not-family-friendly series you may have missed on Hulu: This unconventional police drama stars as Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, a tough-as-nails cop with a penchant for quick-draw shooting. After the \"justified\" shooting of a mob boss in Miami, Raylan is reassigned to his home town of Lexington, Ky.Thanks to whip-smart writing and the charisma of Olyphant, the show lasted on FX for six seasons, all of which can be viewed on Hulu. For those who plan on diving headfirst into Season 1, it deals primarily with Raylan investigating the local Crowder family.Raylan takes an interest in a woman who shot one of the Crowders, her husband, after years of abuse, putting him smack in the crosshairs of their criminal organization. Thanks to performances from Olyphant and Walton Goggins, the first and subsequent seasons of the show were nominated for , making it a justifiable choice for your next big TV obsession. The Hulu original drama based on Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel is being talked about left, right and sideways for good reason. Since debuting in 2017, the show has garnered and 14 overall wins. Whether it's costume design, the haunting dystopian story or rock-solid acting, the series has a lot that's capable of drawing viewers in.Those who take on the first season will be introduced to the world of Gilead. Set in a world where the United States has been reclaimed by religious fanatics after a great civil war, fertility rates among women have collapsed.To solve the problem, the patriarchal society forces women who demonstrate that they can still give birth to be enslaved to elite masters so that they can have their children. These women are called Handmaids. The series focuses on one Handmaid played by \"Mad Men\" star Elisabeth Moss who is captured, separated from her daughter and forced to be enslaved to a prominent couple that had a hand in the creation of Gilead. Inspired by the cult-classic Coen brothers hit film of the same name that came out in 1996, \"Fargo\" debuted in 2014 and has run for three seasons on FX so far. .Billed as a dark comedy/drama, this the perfect selection for someone who is looking for a drama, but doesn't mind keeping things light. Each season focuses on a different part of the same story with Season 1 setting the tone of the narrative that takes place in 2006, Season 2 jumps back in time to 1979 and Season 3 jumps all the way to 2010.For those who plan to fire up the first season, they'll meet Lorne Malvo, played by Billy Bob Thornton. He blows into a sleepy Minnesota town where he reveals himself to be a hitman to the demur Lester Nygaard, played by Martin Freeman. Malvo's influence over both the town and Nygaard becomes apparent and the series sees everyone from humble townsfolk to the law do their best to deal with what's happening around them. This is another terrific TV drama that even the most dedicated TV-viewer may have missed since its debut in 2016. At the time, many joked that the show was a fast-track, one-way ticket to tears. Upon watching the first season, it's clear why.The show focuses on the Pearson family, consisting of two parents and three children (one adopted) who all share the same birthday. What makes \"This Is Us\" unique is the fact that it jumps around in time, showing stories about the family in the present day, future and the past. The first season deals with the family's struggle to reconnect and find happiness with each other in the wake of the loss of a family member, which is kept secret from the audience as a big reveal for later on.The show features an all-star cast including Milo Ventimiglia, Mandy Moore, Sterling K. Brown, Chrissy Metz, Justin Hartley and many more who have had long and storied careers in TV before this. The show is a and has been nominated for 27 since it got its start. With a reported two more seasons left before it takes its final bow, now is the perfect time to catch up on \"This Is Us.\" This drama was produced in the United Kingdom for BBC America. It deals with the intricate life of spies, specifically female assassins.Those who tune into the first season will be introduced to Eve Polastri, an intelligence agent within the British government who is herself obsessed with the psychology of female assassins. When she oversteps on a case, she loses her position only to be recruited by a more clandestine organization that tells her about the hunt for an infamous assassin named Villanelle. However, when the two women finally cross paths, their allegiance may be to each other rather than their respective handlers.The series stars Sandra Oh as Eve and Jodie Comer as Villanelle.

{"url": ["https://www.foxnews.com/sports/transfer-portal-causing-college-basketball-coaches-headaches"], "title": "Transfer portal causing college basketball coaches headaches", "content": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Gregg Marshall began his career as an assistant at tiny Randolph-Macon and Belmont Abbey, but it was during eight years on the staff of Hall of Fame coach John Kresse at College of Charleston that he learned to build a basketball program.Marshall learned how to recruit players who fit his style. He learned how to find overlooked gems, guys who were still growing or had yet to discover their shot. He learned how to sit in their living rooms and convince moms and dads that their sons would get a good education and in four years be prepared for the real world.Many of those lessons have helped Marshall become 's winningest coach. But many have lost their value, and the reason is simple: The NCAA transfer portal has forced coaches to build teams rather than programs.The system was implemented two years ago, intended to help ease the burden on administrators, increase transparency and empower athletes who complained about being prevented at times from going elsewhere. But in the eyes of many coaches, the portal has made transferring too easy, giving players an easy out for any reason: amount of playing time, location, level of competition, even something as silly as school colors.\"It's created a system in which, when problems arise, (players) are not going to fight through the problems and adversity,\" Marshall said. \"You're going to make a move. It's going to be easy to do. That's the problem I see with it.\"The Shockers went 23-8 and spent much of last season hanging around the Top 25, and they were likely to receive an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament had it not been canceled. Fast forward a few weeks and Marshall is wondering how he might need to replace seven players who placed their names in the transfer portal.They run the gamut from high-scoring guard Erik Stevenson, who has committed to Washington, and talented freshman Grant Sherfield, who is headed to Nevada, to role players that hardly saw the floor. But together, they left Marshall with a roster full of holes that he must plug even while the coronavirus pandemic has put the brakes on recruiting.So much for those lessons he picked up from Kresse back in Charleston.More than 500 names have been entered into the portal in the month since the season ended, and new names are added by the day. Some come from big-name programs in search of a fresh start, others from small schools with something to prove. Many are graduate transfers who can play immediately, though most will have to sit out a year under NCAA transfer rules.\"You have to respect each young guy's decision because that's the culture we live in today,\" Missouri coach Cuonzo Martin said. \"You have guys leaving teams. That's just the way it is. But when you're talking about freshmen, they have to have the opportunity to play from Day 1 or you'll be looking at a lot of this.\"No brand of school is unaffected, either.Johnny Juzang and Kahlil Whitney jumped into the portal after their freshman seasons at Kentucky, and Alex O'Connell made the move after his junior year at Duke, creating holes for the bluest of blue bloods. Some Power Five programs such as Iowa State, with five players in the transfer portal, have begun to resemble a bus stop with players coming and going.Then there are the mid-majors such as George Washington, which likewise watched five players enter the portal -- four have already found new homes. In a bit of symmetry, the Colonials have filled three of those scholarships with transfers of their own from Southern Miss, LSU and Vanderbilt.Low-majors are often the hardest hit because one or two star players can make a program, and their departure can be crippling. Terrell Brown averaged 20.7 points per game for Seattle but will be playing for Arizona next season. Jordan Bruner entered the portal after leading Yale to the Ivy League title. Dimencio Vaughn parlayed an All-MAAC season at Rider into a final season with Ole Miss.\"There's a lot of juggling that has to take place because of the transfer portal,\" said Kansas coach Bill Self, who lost elite guard Isaac McBride to Vanderbilt but enjoyed the benefit of getting sharp-shooter Isaiah Moss from Iowa this past season. \"I think that recruiting is more of an inexact science right now than it ever has been.\"Not every coach believes the transfer portal has become a problem.Some of them point to the hypocrisy of coaches being able to freely change schools while players have long been locked into scholarships, and the fact that the transfer portal has created a level playing field where everybody can have a shot at a player interested in new surroundings. Those adept at landing high-profile transfers often have benefited, too.Marshall himself took advantage of the transfer portal to land Connecticut transfer Alterique Gilbert and could be in the market for another player or two.\"The biggest thing for coaches as this transfer portal takes on a life of its own, you're not building a program anymore. I don't know anybody who can do that,\" Marshall said. \"It's hard for us to do that because you're building a team every year.\"", "tags": ["ncaabk", "sports", "ncaa", "wichita-state-shockers", "missouri-tigers"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 04:53:45", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 04:53:49"}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Arturas Karnisovas developed a passion for the when he was a teenager in Lithuania. He watched from afar as Michael Jordan set out on a path that turned Chicago into a championship dynasty and a global brand.Now it's his job to direct Jordan's old team back to the top of the NBA.The Bulls fired general manager Gar Forman on Monday, while officially hiring Karnisovas as their executive vice president of basketball operations and moving John Paxson into an advisory role.The struggling Bulls handed the keys to the 48-year-old Karnisovas last week, convincing him to leave his job as GM of the Denver Nuggets. By making the move now rather than waiting until the season resumes or is called off, they believe they are giving him more time to evaluate the organization.\"This is my dream,\" Karnisovas said during a conference call. \"Our ultimate goal is clearly to bring an NBA championship to the city of Chicago. ... A firm foundation is absolutely vital. I will build that here in Chicago. No skipping steps. There is a systematic approach to success.\"Paxson is moving into a background role as senior advisor of basketball operations after nearly two decades running the department. He took over as general manager for Jerry Krause in 2003 and was promoted to vice president of basketball operations in May 2009, with Forman -- who joined the Bulls as a scout in 1998 -- becoming GM.Chief operating officer Michael Reinsdorf said Paxson told him and his father Jerry Reinsdorf, the team's chairman, in December the front office needed to be restructured and it was time for someone else to lead the operation. Paxson offered to change his role and even step down.\"That's really the kind of person John is,\" Michael Reinsdorf said. \"I've always said that: When the time came to make a change, John would be the one to let us know. That is indeed what ended up happening.\"Jerry Reinsdorf said in a statement that Paxson -- who hit the championship-winning 3-pointer for Chicago against Phoenix in 1993 -- showed why he is \"forever a willing teammate on and off of the court\" by putting the Bulls' interests first and deciding to step aside.While Paxson remains with the organization, Forman is out. And coach Jim Boylen's future remains unclear.Karnisovas said he sees Paxson as \"an asset\" who can be a \"huge help\" as he adjusts to his new job.As for Forman?\"After some consideration and conversations, it was apparent we have different philosophies that would prevent us from moving forward,\" Karnisovas said. \"I'm sure Gar gave his best to the Bulls' organization. But those decisions are never easy. I was hired to affect change.\"Karnisovas prefers a quick pace and players who can handle multiple positions. He offered no timetable for hiring a general manager or deciding the future of Boylen and his staff, saying he will \"do a comprehensive evaluation of every department.\" He did confirm he has hired New Orleans salary-cap specialist J.J. Polk and Denver player-personnel director Pat Connelly for front-office positions.The Bulls thought they were ready to contend for a playoff spot after combining for just 49 wins the past two seasons. Instead, they were 11th in the Eastern Conference at 22-43 when the NBA suspended play because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Denver is third in the Western Conference and leading the Northwest division with a 43-22 record.Karnisovas starred at Seton Hall and had a successful international career that included two Olympic bronze medals for Lithuania. He worked in basketball operations for the NBA from 2003 to 2008 and spent five years as an international scout for the Houston Rockets before joining Denver's front office in 2013. He became the Nuggets' general manager four years later, with Tim Connelly promoted from GM to president of basketball operations.Michael Reinsdorf said Karnisovas' name kept coming up in discussions with other owners, current and former general managers, league officials, ex-players, agents and even media members.He said Nuggets president Josh Kroenke told him he would have \"absolutely\" put Karnisovas in charge had Connelly not passed on an opportunity last year to run the Washington Wizards. That carried plenty of weight, considering Kroenke's hires to lead Denver's front office -- Masai Ujiri and then Tim Connelly.Michael Reinsdorf said he called Karnisovas the night before their interview last week. What he thought would be a quick hello turned into about a 90-minute conversation. Over several more talks the next few days, it became clear to him this was the right person for the job.Michael Reinsdorf just needed his dad's OK. And after a final interview with Jerry, he got it.\"I think what my dad said to me after the meeting when we reconvened was 'I never thought you would find anyone as great as Arturas,'\" Michael Reinsdorf said. \"So I knew we were done.\"", "tags": ["nba", "sports", "chicago-bulls"], "published_time": "2020-04-14 04:47:41", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 04:47:44"}

It turns out the Washington Post had investigated the same allegation, which Biden strongly denies, but declined to publish its findings, before following the Times report yesterday.All three pieces offer a window into how journalism is practiced in this polarizing era.Such is the state of our political tribalism that the president's supporters are lambasting the as an anti-Trump hit piece. It's true that Trump is under a brutally negative media assault, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't take well-documented reporting seriously.Any administration would have faced bureaucratic delays and missteps given the magnitude of the crisis. If Barack Obama were president and had the exact same record, many on the right would be cheering this kind of reporting.It's true, as the president tweeted, that he deserves credit for imposing travel restrictions on China in late January, which was widely criticized as xenophobic.Trump also dismissed a Jan. 29 memo from trade adviser Peter Navarro that explicitly described \"the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.\"The president has said he never read the memo, but the Times' Sunday story says aides raised it with him and he was unhappy that Navarro had put his warning in writing. Navarro of course is not a medical expert, but it turns out he was right.And then there's Trump's HHS secretary, Alex Azar, who warned Trump of the possibility of a pandemic during a call to Air Force One, the second such warning in two weeks. Trump \"responded that Mr. Azar was being alarmist.\" (Trump contends in his tweet that Azar \"told me nothing until later\").During this period, according to an agenda reviewed by the Times, Azar and Anthony Fauci were part of a high-level group that was weighing whether to recommend such steps as school closings and cancellations of mass gatherings. But on Feb. 26, Trump called Azar to express his unhappiness with another top health official, Nancy Messonnier, issuing a blunt public warning that tanked the stock market, and Azar's authority was soon reduced.The Times investigation is certainly open to criticism, like any work of reporting, but the wealth of detail cannot be dismissed as fiction.Also on Sunday, ran a story based in part on interviews with Tara Reade, who briefly worked for Biden's Senate office in 1993. Reade says, as she has claimed publicly, that Biden \"pinned her to a wall in a Senate building, reached under her clothing and penetrated her with his fingers.\" She says that when she pulled away, the senator said \"come on, man, I heard you liked me.\"The strongest point in Reade's favor: \"A friend said that Ms. Reade told her the details of the allegation at the time.\" Another friend and Reade's brother said she told them of a traumatic incident involving Biden over the years.The strongest points against Reade: Two longtime Biden aides flatly deny Reade's account that she complained to them at the time.One, Ted Kaufman, said: \"I did not know her. She did not come to me. If she had, I would have remembered her.\"The other, Dennis Toner, said: \"It's just so preposterous that Senator Biden would be faced with these allegations. \"I don't remember her. I don't remember this conversation. And I would remember this conversation.\"The paper concludes that \"no other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade's allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden.\" (Obviously Biden has acknowledged a history of making some women uncomfortable through hugs and touching.)The political backdrop is that while Reade tweeted positively about the former vice president as recently as 2017, she turned sharply negative against him in the campaign as she first supported Marianne Williamson and Elizabeth Warren, and then backed Bernie Sanders. This raises the question of whether she had any political motivation to exaggerate her original account, which she denies. (Reade filed a report with D.C. police last week that is about Biden but does not name him.), in its own piece yesterday, revealed it had interviewed Reade last year as well as this year, but obviously chose not to publish until the Times went first.The strongest point against Reade is that she changed her story. She told the Post last year \"that Biden had touched her neck and shoulders but did not mention the alleged assault or suggest there was more to the story. She faulted his staff, calling Biden 'a male of his time, a very powerful senator, and he had people around saying it was okay...\"This is what I want to emphasize: It's not him. It's the people around him who keep covering for him.'\"Reade now says she \"didn't have the courage to come forward\" about the assault, but has come to feel \"stronger about speaking my truth.\"Another questionable point: Reade said she filed a complaint in 1993 with a congressional personnel office -- just about the harassment, not the assault -- but could not remember its name. The Post could find no record of that, and Reade said she never got a copy.Biden critics would fault the media's delay, but both papers made a good-faith effort to investigate Reade's accusations and go beyond the he said/she said. They found some discrepancies and holes in her story, raising questions about why she's going public now, but that doesn't mean she isn't telling the truth. What it does mean, as with the coronavirus story, is that journalism is a process that can only build a structure brick by brick.", "tags": ["mediabuzz", "media"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 15:51:03", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 03:26:32"}

U.S. officials relied on data from epidemiologists to prevent the country from spiraling into a more severe health crisis. A famous saying in the early days of the crackdown was: better to overreact than to underreact.But after weeks of adhering to strict social distancing guidelines that were praised by health experts, the country is experiencing some dramatic side effects.

People have been barred from going to church, visiting relatives and holding weddings and funerals. But Trump's main concern appears to be the economy, which has shed more than 16 million jobs in just three weeks.\"If it were up to the doctors, they may say, 'Let's keep it shut down -- let's shut down the entire world,\" Trump told reporters last month. \"You can't do that with a country -- especially the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world, by far ... you can't do that.

He said that he has been holding discussions with senior aides on how to roll back federal social distancing recommendations that are set to expire at the end of the month. He stressed that he wants Americans to be \"very, very safe.\"But there are huge risks in restarting the nation, primarily that the deadly virus could regain momentum. Trump has said the call confronting him is \"the biggest decision\" of his lifetime.Health officials are still learning about the coronavirus' transmission and -- since its early days in the U.S. -- have stressed that the most effective way to protect yourself from the virus is to practice social distancing and proper hygiene, like frequent handwashing.Until there is herd immunity, a cure or a vaccine, the threat to the public will likely remain.Little has changed from the federal government's 100-page response plan last month that warned that the coronavirus will last for \"18 months or longer,\" according to \"It's not going to be a light switch that we say, 'OK, it is now June, July, or whatever, click, the light switch goes back on. It's going to be depending where you are in the country, the nature of the outbreak that you already experienced and the threat of an outbreak that you may not have experienced,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Sunday.Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Thursday that, at best, the U.S. is looking at a mild recession, like in the aftermath of 9/11. \"If this is a three-month shutdown, we'll find the bottom pretty soon,\" he said. \"If this is a yearlong shutdown, this could be very damaging to the U.S. economy, and most importantly, to the American people.\"Trump has said that the health of Americans is always at the center of his policy decisions. As of early Tuesday, Johns Hopkins reported that there were 582,607 official cases in the U.S. and 23,000 deaths.George Lowenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, that it might be a \"false dichotomy\" to make the choice between human lives and the economy.He said it is unclear what the long-term impact a severe depression would have on human life.\"It will dramatically decrease the quality of human life, and it will certainly kill people as well,\" he said. He continued, \"We've already had unprecedented levels of deaths of despair, and, if we lose a generation as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, that's going to have mortality consequences.\"Trump signed a last month to help prop up small businesses and families across the U.S. It was reported Monday that the for qualifying Americans will be sent out this week. Nearly 17 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March and that the numbers are expected to keep worsening. \"We clearly are still processing individuals who are having a hard time getting claims through at the state level in addition to the large numbers of layoffs that corporate America is now doing,\" Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist for RSM US LLP, told the Journal. He said he would not be surprised to see the unemployment rate up to 20 percent, which rivals Great Depression numbers. John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law school professor, recently told the Federalist Society in a phone call that there are clear limits on what the president and federal government can enact when it comes \"to domestic affairs.\"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said \"the government doesn't get opened up via Twitter. It gets opened up at the state level.\"Trump himself has said that state governors should lead the response and for good reason. States like Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana all have under 750 cases. New York, on the other hand, has nearly 200,000 cases.The Smithfield pork-producing plant in Sioux Falls was closed after hundreds of its employees tested positive for the virus, raising concerns that the country could be headed to meat supply issues.\"It is impossible to keep our grocery stores stocked if our plants are not running,\" Kenneth Sullivan, the company's CEO, said.Six governors from states in the Northeast have formed a joint reopening task force after signs that the curve is flattening. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York Democrat who is part of the task force, said that the economy will have to be slowly reopened. \"If you see [infections start rising] then you know you've opened the valve too fast,\" he said.Besides the country's health and economy, another concern for some Americans was how quickly individual liberties were sacrificed during statewide orders. Americans were told to stay indoors and state governments were tasked to determine which businesses were \"essential\" and which were \"nonessential.\"Pastors in some Southern states have found themselves on the wrong side of the law for allegedly breaking social distancing guidelines and holding public services. Some of these pastors questioned how a grocery store could be considered \"essential\" and a church \"nonessential.\"Yoo, the Berkeley law professor, and Harmeet K. Dhillon, a lawyer, and Republican Party official, co-authored a column for the Hoover Institution that said under the Constitution's system of federalism, \"the authority to lift the quarantine orders lies in the same people who issued them in the first place: the state governors.\"\"Our state officials should explain whether they could have implemented other policies that could have reduced the spread of the disease without incurring such massive economic destruction,\" they . \"Was any consideration given to the human health effects of the mandatory stay-at-home order, including exacerbation of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety; a predicted increase in domestic violence; suicides by business owners facing debt and ruin?

The use of that type of projectile is unusual considering the country reportedly possesses just two known cruise missiles purposed for anti-ship operations, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.If confirmed, it would be the North's first cruise missile launch since June 2017, per the defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Later on Tuesday, North Korea launched fighter jets which fired an unspecified number of air-to-surface missiles towards the same waters, the official added.

Why did you do that?\" Smith asked.\"Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper, I think that the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct, and that's not what the sentence was intended to say,\" Baquet responded.\"Why not explain that?\" Smith followed.\"We didn't think it was a factual mistake,\" Baquet replied. \"I thought it was an awkward phrasing issue that could be read different ways and that it wasn't something factual we were correcting. So, I didn't think that was necessary.\"The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

If you ask the average person in America, they didn't know about the Tara Reade case,\" Baquet told Smith. \"So I thought, in that case, if The New York Times was going to introduce this to readers, we needed to introduce it with some reporting and perspective.

Despite the fact I come from a family of Democrats. I worked for Leon Panetta, [California] State Sen. Jack O'Connell and Joe Biden. I worked hard for the Democratic Party as a young woman. It is obvious by the tremendous smears about me leveled by Biden campaign and supporters after I came forward about Biden and the complete lack of support from any Democrat that they care more about protecting Joe Biden than addressing the serious allegations by me and the other seven women who complained about his misconduct.\"She continued, \"Kamala Harris is my representative and I reached out to her for help. No response. Joe Biden sexually assaulted and harassed me. All the rest of political discussion is noise and an effort to distract from the serious lack of justice I experienced at his hands. Coming forward has been difficult and resulted in 1993 with the loss of my job and career. Coming forward last spring 2019 about the sexual harassment resulted with his supporters smearing me online. And now, again. So, no, I will not vote for Joe Biden.\"Harris did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.In a statement, Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director said the former vice president has \"dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women,\" pointing to his work passing the Violence Against Women Act.She said that \"he firmly believes that women have a right to be heard -- and heard respectfully,\" but added: \"Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press.\"Biden's conduct towards women first came under scrutiny just before he announced his presidential campaign last spring. Eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations that the former vice president made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate physical displays of affection.Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to \"be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future.\"Reade, who was a staff assistant in Biden's office at the time, said she wasn't aware of any direct witnesses to the encounter.She told The Associated Press she did raise accusations of sexual harassment, but not assault, against Biden in multiple meetings with her supervisors. She filed a police report in Washington this past Thursday saying she was the victim of a sexual assault by an unnamed person in 1993, a copy of which the AP obtained.Reade's story first resurfaced in an article in . Podcast host Katie Halper then interviewed Reade, who said that in 1993, a more senior member of Biden's staff asked her to bring the then-senator his gym bag near the Capitol building, which led to the encounter in question.\"He greeted me, he remembered my name, and then we were alone. It was the strangest thing,\" Reade told Halper. \"There was no like, exchange really. He just had me up against the wall.\"Reade said she tried to share her story last year, but nobody listened to her.She added: \"If people want to know why women don't come forward, that's a good example of why.\"", "tags": ["joe-biden", "politics", "2020-presidential-election", "democrats", "presidential", "kamala-harris", "tara-reade"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 20:55:01", "modified_time": "2020-04-29 09:53:17"}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The is under fire after Taiwan released the contents of a December email inquiring about the person-to-person spread of , which it says was ignored by the organization and further denied to provide adequate information about how to fight the virus.Taiwan is accusing WHO of downplaying the severity and spread of the coronavirus in an attempt to pander to China, even after Taiwan sounded the alarm about at least seven cases of atypical pneumonia that they were aware of in Wuhan, where the virus originated.When asked about the cases by the media, Taiwan said China's health authorities said, \"The cases were believed not SARS; however samples are still under examination, and cases have been isolated for treatment,\" according to the contents of an email sent by Taiwan's Center for Disease Control and Prevention to WHO on Dec. 31.\"I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us,\" the email said.Taiwan is located about 80 miles off China's coast but has declared itself an independent nation for over 70 years. China, however, has refused to acknowledge Taiwan's sovereignty and consistently fights to bring it back under Beijing's control.As a result, China has successfully persuaded WHO to exclude Taiwan from the organization.The WHO denied that Taiwan ever alerted them to the potential person-to-person spread of the virus, but Taiwan's CDC said that because they specifically mentioned \"atypical pneumonia\" - reminiscent of SARS, which is transmitted via human contact - \"public health professionals could discern from this wording that there was a real possibility of human-to-human transmission of the disease,\" they said in a press release.\"However, because at the time there were as yet no cases of the disease in Taiwan, we could not state directly and conclusively that there had been human-to-human transmission,\" Taiwan's CDC said.Taiwan said that WHO and the Chinese CDC both refused to provide adequate information that could have potentially prepared the government for the impact of the virus sooner.WHO ignored warnings from Taiwan and continued to reiterate China's false talking points -- that \"there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission\" of the novel pathogen even as late as Jan 14.In addition, WHO failed to mandate that Chinese officials share the viral strains that would have allowed diagnostic tests to have been produced significantly earlier worldwide.Tensions between Taiwan and the WHO have caused President Trump to consider pulling funding from the U.N. agency, which receives the bulk of its money from U.S taxpayers' dollars.Trump said Monday during the White House's coronavirus task force briefing that he expects to reach a decision by the end of the week -- days after he vowed that his administration would be \"looking into\" WHO's operations.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has accused the U.S. of \"politicizing\" its handling of the virus and said that doing so would result in \"more body bags.\"Currently, the coronavirus pandemic has killed 118,854 people in the world and infected over 2 million others.", "tags": ["world-health-organization", "world", "coronavirus", "china"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 18:52:22", "modified_time": "2020-04-14 09:02:06"}

That task falls to the league's Undergraduate Advisory Committee, which understands that what it says in these uncertain times may carry even more weight than usual.\"This is a process that's important, maybe more important this year than ever,\" said Kiki VanDeWeghe, the NBA's Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations and UAC committee chair. \"We're trying to get the athletes and the schools as much information as we possibly can. It's important that they have the clearest picture.\"Because of the coronavirus pandemic that has shut down the sports world, including the NBA, nobody knows when the draft will be held, who will have the No. 1 overall pick or how that will be decided. Nobody even knows when or if the draft combine, which is scheduled for mid-May and technically has not yet been changed, will take place.When underclassmen ask, the NBA sends evaluations with a percentage of likelihood that they will fall into one of five draft-night categories -- lottery (picks 1-14), first-round non-lottery (picks 15-30), first half of second round (picks 31-45), second half of second round (picks 46-60), and undrafted.It's not an exact science, but the league has pretty good success with it: Since 2016, based on its own evaluation and feedback that the 30 NBA teams share as part of the process, the league has told 66 candidates that they are first-round material and 49 others that they wouldn't be drafted. They hit on 89% of those first-round projections and 96% of the undrafted projections.\"It is unprecedented times and difficult times for everybody and we try to do our best to make that easier for student athletes as far as navigating that process and understanding that process,\" VanDeWeghe said. \"This is a time of uncertainty. Even in a normal year, student athletes are very nervous about applying of the draft. But our role in this is to try to give as much information as we possibly can.\"The UAC will continue sending evaluations through April 26, which is also the league's deadline for players to officially decide if they will enter the draft. Typically, they could start setting up workouts almost immediately after that date but the league's shutdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic has all that on indefinite hold.So far, about 200 college early entry and international players have tested the waters for this draft. Most will withdraw, and that number is consistent with last year -- when the league saw 219 hopefuls. Those applicants are not just getting their potential draft slot, but the league is taking the additional step this year of offering mental health resources under the advice of Dr. Kensa Gunter and Dr. Vic Schwartz -- an extra and necessary part of the puzzle, the NBA thinks, given the unprecedented nature of these times.The evaluation-request and early entry deadlines aren't changing, as of now anyway, VanDeWeghe said. Everything else is on a very fluid timetable.\"The in-person workouts and the combine and all of that type of stuff looks like it will be significantly impacted by COVID-19, but it doesn't mean that the work stops,\" Los Angeles Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said. \"Our scouts are doing tons of film study. I'm doing tons of synergy, watching, studying guys overseas, studying guys here, and that work has to continue. We have to be as well-prepared as we can for when the draft occurs.\"The draft was supposed to be June 25. That now seems highly unlikely, and plenty of teams have asked the NBA for a delay that looks inevitable. The NBA is looking at several options, just as it is when it comes to possibilities for resuming the season when public health officials say that would be appropriate.Not having NCAA Tournament games is not hurting the process, VanDeWeghe said, noting that the players who are most likely to come out early -- especially the likely lottery and first-round picks -- have been well-known to teams and scouts for many years.\"We'll get through this,\" VanDeWeghe said. \"We'll get through it together and hopefully come out the other side a little better, a little stronger, a little wiser.\"", "tags": ["nba-draft", "sports", "nba"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 21:06:47", "modified_time": "2020-04-13 21:09:55"}

Though she told the publication she did not want to be \"divisive,\" she said the process of unifying the party should not be easy, and made a distinction between supporting Biden and offering a full endorsement of his campaign.\"The whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved--that's how you know it's working,\" she said. \"If Biden is only doing things he's comfortable with, then it's not enough.\"The Biden campaign declined to comment on the Times report.In the last several weeks, the campaign has tried to unite more moderate Democrats and progressive voters, a group Biden has struggled to court. Aside from engaging younger Americans and advocates for race and justice issues, they said they're also focusing specifically on certain groups: legacy progressive organizations with extensive policy focuses, large national networks such as Planned Parenthood and new-movement progressive organizations using grassroots organizing to focus on social-justice issues -- groups including March for our Lives.Ahead of Sanders' surprise endorsement of Biden, spokesman Matt Hill told Fox News the Biden campaign was \"continuously considering and evaluating additional policies that would build upon Vice President Biden's progressive agenda,\" adding that the campaign has been in contact with progressive leaders and organizations in the last month.\"The most important piece of engaging progressive leaders and groups is to ensure we're expanding and broadening our coalition to beat Donald Trump in November, and we are working with these leaders and groups to align on our efforts to do that. Defeating Trump is the universal commitment that we all share,\" he emphasized.Last Thursday, one day after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden released two new policy proposals mirroring Sanders' ideas to lower the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and forgive student debt for low-income and middle-class families. But, University of Houston political science professor Brandon Rottinghaus warns Sanders' full-throated endorsement might not be enough.\"This will partially help to unite the party from a symbolic point of view. From a substantive view, many in Sanders' camp won't be satisfied with just a surface-level endorsement. The hardcore Sanders supporters want substantive change that they're worried Joe Biden or another establishment candidate won't provide. If there's no substantive change that Bien provides, then Sanders' endorsement would mean very little,\" Rottinghaus said.Meanwhile, Biden, during a joint virtual event with Sanders on Monday, invoked the Vermont senator's slogan, \"Not Me, Us,\" in an appeal to his supporters.\"I'm excited to do the work with you in the months and years ahead. You know, as you say, not me, us, not me, us, that's your phrase pal, and your supporters and I are going to make the same commitment... I tell your supporters I see you, I hear you. I understand the urgency of what it is that we have to get done in this country, and I hope you'll join us.

I didn't know where I was going. I went to the psychologist when I was 21 and I continued for about eight years to try to understand more about my mind, my psyche, how I could return back to my sense of joy.\"In the '70s, when \"meditation was really happening,\" as Hawn put it, she was initiated at a Transcendental Meditation center, leading to a \"visceral\" and \"amazing\" experience.\"I rediscovered something in that one sitting. I can't explain the joy that was brought back to me. It was a transformational 'Aha!' moment for me,\" the \"\" star recalled. \"It stabilized my mind and gave me a piece of my interior that was all mine. No one could touch it.

Hawn has produced a number of movies she starred in, but also vessels for the likes of Julia Roberts and Holly Hunter -- all with a specific goal in mind.\"Women were my obvious focus,\" Hawn said, \"because it is not always easy having power and being female. ... That's the way it was. It wasn't that all men were terrible or that the situation was unbearable. It was a cultural problem.\"While the actress believes that the #MeToo movement has made headway in terms of remedying such a situation, she also remembers when women \"had to make our way around the patriarchal society, how men, the culture and the world, looked at women.\"\"A lot of it could be sleazy. I went through that,\" she recounted to The Guardian. \"A lot of it could be: 'You're powerful now; who do you think you are?' Some of it is stopping women from doing the things they want to do, and in relationships, making women feel bad about themselves.\"Hawn took a break from Hollywood for 15 years, starring in \"The Banger Sisters\" and producing \"The Matthew Shepard Story\" in 2002, then not returning to her craft until she lent her voice to a 2013 episode of \"Phineas and Ferb.\"\"I wasn't going to wait for a phone to ring,\" Hawn explained. \"And I certainly wasn't going to continue to produce, because I produced for like 25 years and I didn't want to do that anymore. I'd done it, I did it, it was done. Great, but now it's time to move on.\"During her time off, Hawn has kept busy with various projects, such as the development of Mind Up, an organization dedicated to \"helping children develop the mental fitness necessary to thrive in school and throughout their lives,\" according to its \"My interests are vast and I'm fascinated with the human condition, spirituality and religiosity,\" she said.Her interest in the Mind Up cause began as she was doing research for a documentary on happiness, surprised by the high suicide rates of young people. Following 9/11, she \"went vigilante\" and developed the organization in 18 months.After conducting research with the University of British Columbia, Hawn found positive results stemming from her curriculum.\"These children had changed in a matter of four months, and had a whole new way of being,\" she recalled. \"They understood their emotional systems in the brain, that the hippocampus is where they remember, the amygdala, which is fight-or-flight.\"The iconic star also offered a tip for those stuck inside during the coronavirus quarantine.\"Before you go to bed, think of three things that went well today,\" she advised. \"I don't care if it's a little crazy thing - it doesn't matter.\"", "tags": ["thennow", "entertainment", "celebrity", "movies"], "published_time": "2020-04-13 20:14:57", "modified_time": "2020-04-13 21:16:34"}

Sanders ended his White House bid last Wednesday, the day after the primary. He backed Biden earlier Monday.But, the Democrats' - in which 85 convention delegates have been up for grabs - was far from the only race on the ballot. There were numerous municipal general elections, including in Milwaukee, the state's largest city. And, there was a crucial contest for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, where conservative-aligned justices had a 5-2 majority over progressive justices. With more than 90 percent of precincts reporting, challenger Jill Karofsky lead incumbent Daniel Kelly - whom Republican ex-Gov.

Tony Evers, a Democrat who twice tried to postpone in-person voting and extend the ability to cast ballots by mail.The governor's executive order - following an urgent warning by mayors from Wisconsin's largest cities that \"hundreds of thousands of citizens at risk by requiring them to vote at the polls while this ugly pandemic spreads\" - drew instant pushback from the GOP-controlled state legislature before the Republican-dominated state Supreme Court overturned it the evening before the vote.The partisan fight over the election - an initial skirmish for a brewing larger national showdown over voting rights - extended all the way to Washington. On the eve of the primary, the struck down a federal district court's ruling allowing a weeklong extension to return absentee ballots. The ruling by the high court broke along ideological lines, with the five judges appointed by Republicans winning out over the four appointed by Democrats.With the state under a stay-at-home order, thousands of poll workers refused to show up over health concerns, forcing many cities and towns to cut the number of polling stations. Milwaukee was down to just five polling sites from the original 180.Even though the National Guard stepped in to provide some assistance, long lines instantly formed as the polls opened, with many voters waiting hours to cast a ballot. In many instances, social distancing was extremely difficult to maintain.Democrats in Wisconsin and across the nation decried the rulings to carry on with the in-person voting during the pandemic. Biden, in a video tweeted out on Monday night following the release of the results, praised state and local election officials for carrying out their duties in \"the most difficult of circumstances.\"\"It should have never come to that,\" he added. \"No one should ever have to choose between their health and our democracy.

The Saudi Arabian oil facilities attacked from Iran are located across the Persian Gulf, an area where Saudi forces had largely not protected with air defense systems, the official said. Not all the Iran weapons hit their target in Saudi Arabia. Some fell short.The U.S. Patriot missile defense system does not have 360-degree coverage. The Patriot radar can only point in one direction. Most of Saudi Arabia's air defense systems are in the south to protect from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who have launched rockets, drones and missiles into the Kingdom for years. One official called the area in Saudi Arabia where the Iranian forces hit, a \"blind spot.\"U.S. teams are on the ground in Saudi Arabia collecting the debris from the weapons used in the attack, which knocked out half the Kingdom's oil capacity. Some officials have said Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen could have also launched a small attack into southern Saudi Arabia, but that the main attack came from Iran.\"Iran has a long history of testing its strength. But they never climb too high up the escalation ladder. At a certain point, when the world says enough, they come back down,\" a senior administration official told Fox News. \"We do see a role for the UN Security Council to play. Saudi was attacked and it would be appropriate for them to call upon the Council. But we first need to gather the releasable information.\"The attack against the oil facilities last weekend showed 17 direct hits to the oil tanks and other infrastructure, according to satellite imagery released by the Trump administration, showing much greater proficiency with their more advanced weapons, officials say. Officials and intelligence analysts have shot down Houthi rebel claims that they fired them from Yemen territory. Iraq categorically denied that the attacks came from within its borders, despite it being a geographic possibility. U.S. surveillance is not reported to have detected a boat in the Persian Gulf that technically could have been utilized as a discharge pad.The investigation has thus turned more to Iranian terrain - and the probability that it was not just drones used to decimate at least 17 targets and knock out 5.7 million barrels of daily oil production - but cruise missiles.The Houthis may have been involved in a small attack, but it is a diversion from the main culprit and the broader attack 500 miles north, officials say.President Trump has dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia for urgent consultations.A spokesperson for the Houthi rebel group told Fox News that the government of Iran backs them and provides them with weapons and logistical support, but claimed that the relationship between the two has mostly been overblown.Indeed, the sophistication of the assault, according to defense and geospatial experts, indicates a level far beyond the capability Houthis have demonstrated in previous infiltrations of Saudi airspace in terms of its precision, scope and distance.Abqaiq, one of the two major facilities that came under the air bombardment over the weekend, is one of the most vital oil production facilities in the Gulf as it carries out the intricate process of cleaving the hydrogen-sulfide gas from oil.\"Abqaiq is an over-centralized chokepoint. More than two-thirds of Saudi crude oil goes through that one facility on its way from the wells to export terminals. Abqaiq is where Aramco takes gas, dirt, sand, sulfur, and other impurities out of the stuff that flows up from wells,\" said Joseph Duggan, a geopolitical consultant who worked as a speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush, in the State Department for President Ronald Reagan, and in Saudi Arabia for six years at Aramco headquarters. \"Abqaiq will have to be rebuilt, but the Saudis also should build redundant facilities dispersed around their country for the processing and blending that is now done primarily at Abqaiq,\" he added.Duggan also noted that Iran has undertaken cyberattacks against Aramco in the past, including malware that killed most Aramco desktop computers in 2012 and malware that attempted to spark an explosion at a petrochemical plant in 2017.So what does an investigation of this scale involve as to who was behind the attacks?\"Radar tracks. The area is heavily trafficked by aircraft so there will be radar records from commercial and military sources. Pieces of weapon debris, which give insight into weapon type, country of origin (manufacture), circuits that may contain programming, etc.,\" explained Lt. Col. Dakota Wood, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation. \"Analysis of attack vector - all targets hit from a specific direction, for example, accuracy and timing of hits - did all weapons hit their target with a precision and/or timed sequence that would imply sophistication in planning and execution of the attack.\" He also said investigators would be looking for eyewitness accounts, as well as isolate any \"chatter\" or intercepts acquired by intelligence services that would reveal a \"controlling hand\" or communications between/among people that would reveal individuals, organizations and chain of command.\"Satellite imagery or video that might reveal the movement of units or pieces of equipment necessary to execute such an attack. And the effect of the munitions used - weapon platform, warhead, or explosive was able to penetrate 'x' or caused 'y' damage at a given level,\" Wood surmised. \"By combining all of the bits and pieces of information, one is able to dismiss many possible actors and narrow the focus on just those able to acquire and employ the types of weapons used, reveals how close they had to have been to prosecute the attack and who was communicating with whom in the time leading up to, during, and after the attack.\"Tehran has vehemently rejected any involvement, but such familiar denials are so far falling on deaf ears.\"We want to find definitively who did this,\" President Trump said in a press briefing Monday afternoon. \"We pretty much already know.\"", "tags": ["saudi-arabia", "world", "iran", "mideast"], "published_time": "2019-09-17 14:17:23", "modified_time": "2019-09-17 18:45:48"}

And the second reason it's ending is that the Trump administration has yet to impose a cost on Iran for its malign behavior that sends a signal to Iran that they can no longer continue attacks like these.BAIER: Do we think, though, that the Saudis are going to make an appeal to the international community through the United Nations? They didn't particularly like that play when it came to Khashoggi, but would they be doing that? Is that the path that we're going to see with the Secretary of State and others meeting with the Saudis, do you think, Josh?JOSH HOLMES, CAVALRY CONSULTANTS: I think they welcome all the help they can get. I think the question is whether that falls on deaf ears or not.And to go back to Matt's point, I don't think there's any question at this point about what Iran is doing. Since may there have been 40 attacks that we know about, 40 attacks initiated by Iran on interests in the area, including three drones, American drones, that have been shot down. We know what they're trying to do. The question is whether or not we're going to acknowledge at some point that one country is at war. It's not us. And whether or not we are going to do anything to protect our allies and our interest in the region. And I think at some point, the president is going to have to answer that question.LIASSON: But so far he's talked about meeting with no preconditions, although he kind of walked that back, we think. He's talked about lifting the sanctions. I have no idea what the White House's Iran strategy is. Do you?HOLMES: No. It's unclear to me. What I do know --BAIER: Let me play the soundbite. This is about the meeting or potential meeting at the U.N. General Assembly, or wherever, with the Iranians.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I have no meetings scheduled. I know they want to meet. I know they are not doing well as a country.AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER (through translator): Sometimes they speak of unconditional talks. Sometimes they speak of talks without precondition, and some other times, they speak of talks with 12 conditions. It is because either their politics is a chaotic one and they do not know what they want.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: And let's be clear, when it comes to Iran, that's the guy that matters, period, the end. The Supreme Leader.HOLMES: No question about it. And I think you can praise this administration for having a more restrained approach across the globe, really, and looking at each of these international incidents in their own set of contexts. But I think what we are working with here with Iran is something that's been going on an awful long time. There's absolutely I don't think any question about what their intention is trying to do, is escalate this to the point where they get some kind of an interaction with the United States. The question is whether it's on our terms or whether it's on their terms. And I think right now they're dictating the state of play.BAIER: Meantime, another big story in the Middle East is the Israeli elections. The counting for that vote happening at this hour. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): You want to prevent a left-wing government and a coalition with the Arab parties? You do not want it, so go vote. Go vote Likud.BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER CANDIDATE (through translator): Who here hasn't voted, raise your hand. Who has voted? You voted. Great. All the rest, go and vote. Go vote blue and white. There is a blue and white flag. You want to wake up a country with hope, to unify a country? Go vote.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Benny Gantz versus Bibi Netanyahu. At this hour, the early exit polls, Matthew, suggest that it doesn't look good for Benjamin Netanyahu, but we've been here before where it didn't look good, and then suddenly he pulls it out in the end. It's all about setting up a coalition government eventually.CONTINETTI: Right. There are two contests. One is the actual vote. And then there is after the vote is the contest to set up a governing coalition where Bibi may still have a few cards to play even if he is denied a majority in the actual vote totals.I think, Bret, when we look back on this election, we might see Bibi fatigue as a little bit of a factor. He is Israel's longest serving prime minister. That is no small feat. And in the run-up to this election in recent weeks, he has continued to make promise after promise that I think may have actually alienated some of his core supporters.BAIER: How does the President Trump play there, do you think?LIASSON: That is a really interesting question because Netanyahu has used Trump as more than a crutch. You've got the seven-foot tall posters of Trump and Netanyahu, and Trump has been an incredible friend to Netanyahu and has done almost everything he wanted. But he's been a little bit, it sounds like he's been hedging his bets a little bit recently because he's not so sure Bibi is going to pull it out. But if he loses, what happens to Trump's relationships with the Israeli government, that's going to be really interesting.BAIER: And again, we're still waiting on the raw vote total to come in, and those are early projections which sometimes, we've seen in this country, can be wrong, Josh.HOLMES: Yes, and over there where it's been wrong, too. They've had exit polls that have been famously official. But I will say, I think it has less to do with Bibi Netanyahu's foreign policy, domestic policy, or even his embrace of President Trump. I think President Trump is still extremely popular in Israel.I think the issue fundamentally is what Matthew was referring to earlier, that there is some Bibi fatigue. There has been an awful lot of drama surrounding the last three years, investigation after investigation. And I think even for his core supporters, at some point you kind of have to turn the page on some of that.I'm not saying that this is going to be a definitive election. Clearly we're going down the wire. He may pull it out, may actually form a government. But I think that is some of the underlying angst there.BAIER: Quickly.CONTINETTI: The irony for many Democrats and liberals in the United States who wish Bibi to leave the stage is that Gantz may end up being a more hawkish prime minister than Bibi Netanyahu.BAIER: Which is tough to think about, but yes, you're right.Speaking of investigations after investigation, did you see the Corey Lewandowski hearing today? Stay tuned.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JERROLD NADLER, D-N.Y., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The White House is a new and dangerous theory, the crony privilege. It makes absolute immunity look good by comparison. Where are the limits. This is a cover- up, plain and simple.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: I recognize that the privilege is not mine. Congressman, I would be happy to answer your question, or you can just have a conversation by yourself. But if you would like to ask me a question, I'll be happy to answer.SHEILA JACKSON LEE, D-TX, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: He called you in to do his dirty work in secret because he knew it was wrong.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Time.LEE: We will expose the truth. The president cannot hide behind you any longer.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Time.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: That's basically how that five-and-a-half hours went in the committee hearing today. Corey Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager testifying in front of the House Judiciary Committee. We're back with the panel. Matthew, I'm not sure what the purpose was going in. Did the Democrats not know that Corey Lewandowski was going to do that?CONTINETTI: The news is that the Democrats have missed an incredible marketing opportunity, Bret, because really they are putting these hearings up on C-SPAN for free when they should be selling the rights to a streaming service and charging admission, and adding extra for popcorn, because this is entertainment. It's theater. It's not actual legal politics. We are not sure whether it's an impeachment investigation, or is it or is it not. It is simply there to prove to the far left Democratic base that the Democrats, yes, maybe one of these days will get around to impeaching Donald Trump.BAIER: At times it was fiery. Here is Lewandowski with the back and forth about impeaching him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: The White House has directed that I not disclose the substance of any discussion with the president or his advisers.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I ask that you would judge him in contempt in these proceedings.JERROLD NADLER, D-N.Y., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Mr. Lewandowski, when you refuse to answer these questions, you are obstructing the work of our committee.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman, did you just threaten to impeach Mr. Lewandowski, a private citizen?NADLER: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: It was back and forth. It was unreal, Mara.LIASSON: I don't know what the Democrats thought that he would do. First of all, he had an audience of one, and I thought he played to that audience of one really well. He is also thinking about running for Senate in a Republican primary in New Hampshire. So I don't know what they thought that he would do, but if they felt that he was obstructing the committee, they can hold him in contempt. What are they going to do next?BAIER: Speaking of the audience of one, President Donald Trump tweeting out after this hearing started, and obviously watching him, \"Such a beautiful opening statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you, Corey!\" Just making sure everybody knew that he was tuned in.HOLMES: I'm sure he was delighted. But I've long maintained that the best way to have somebody look credible and intellectual is put them before a House panel, because it is just an absolute mess every single time out, and this time absolutely no exception.To Mara's point, Corey understands this, and what he is doing is embarking upon a potential Senate run. He launched a website halfway through the hearing. And so from an operative standpoint, this was a pretty smart deal, and he got exactly what he wanted out of the Democrats in that panel.BAIER: Let's turn to 2020, this new Trump campaign video that has surfaced about Joe Biden.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think Biden looked unstudy at many points.JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Play the radio. Make sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is not the polished speaker anymore.BIDEN: The president thinks -- my friend from Vermont thinks that --UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Watching his long winding answers that don't really make sense in recent debates has also raised the question as to whether that has gotten worse and whether he is up for this.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: It's a brutal, kind of long campaign video. But is it like a shark attacks, we are focused on them so there's more of them, or are there more gaffes that are big, big problems for Joe Biden?CONTINETTI: Well, they gaffes have followed Joe Biden like a cloud since he entered the Senate in 1973. So I don't think it's a shark attack thing. I do think this is telegraphing what a general election attack will look like on Joe Biden should he be the Democratic nominee. And the question is, we know that he's electable, according to the polls. But the Democrats understand that the second that this electable candidate wins the nomination, he will be deluged with ads questioning his age and his fitness for the presidency that may well be effective.BAIER: Here's todays. Did you see todays? Here you go.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: You're out there working, even if you have a good union job, try getting childcare in Philadelphia. You're talking $20,000 a year for somebody to do that. You get a tax break for a racehorse, why in God's name couldn't we provide an $8,000 tax credit for everybody who has childcare costs? It would put 720 million women back in the workforce.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: There are 330 million people in the United States of America.LIASSON: But you know what, maybe the old rules don't work anymore. Look at all the things that Donald Trump did and said that we thought would scuttle any other normal candidate, and it didn't. I don't know the answer to this question, but I wonder if maybe Biden is impervious.BAIER: Josh?HOLMES: The problem is the narrative is starting to take hold here, right. And Democratic primary voters are actually struggling. We saw Castro bring this up in the context of the last debate.BAIER: Cory Booker did too in interviews afterwards.HOLMES: Right. The case that they are making is you're either going to vote for Joe Biden or you're going to call in a silver, because at some point he's so unsteady that you can't trust him with carrying the Democratic nomination. And I think at this point he's giving him a lot of fodder.BAIER: Last word. \"New York Times,\" how damaging in the big picture of the narrative for Democrats?CONTINETTI: I think it's extremely damaging for \"The New York Times.\" For the Democrats, it's a big issue, because it elevates the one thing that unifies the Republican Party and conservative movement, Brett Kavanaugh and conservative judges on the bench. As long as that is an issue, it helps the Republican Party.BAIER: OK panel, thank you. When we come back, some fireworks you may have missed from today's Corey Lewandowski hearing.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Finally tonight, we showed you some of the Corey Lewandowski hearing earlier, but some of the greatest hits or lowest blows didn't really make the early report. Here's a compilation of some other fiery exchanges.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you the hitman, the bagman?LEWANDOWSKI: I think I'm the good- looking man, actually.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Lewandowski, you are about like a fish being cleaned with a spoon. It's very hard to get an answer out of you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We could have talked today about your favorite football team. I'm not --LEWANDOWSKI: Patriots.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Patriots. You're pretty happy right now, right?LEWANDOWSKI: Tom is a winner.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a House Judiciary, not a House party.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Wow, it was quite something, for hours on end.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comThe -based organization founded to address the issue of sexual abuse in at the youth level is fielding 55 percent more reports of misconduct this year than in 2018, leading to an increasingly urgent debate over who should provide the lion's share of money to an organization struggling to manage its caseload.The U.S. Center for SafeSport received a $1.3 million infusion from the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, bringing the USOPC's overall contribution to $7.4 million in 2019. National governing bodies (NGBs) which oversee the individual Olympic sports have contributed $2.05 million for this year. That amount, plus a small government grant and other donations, brings the center's operating budget for 2019 to $10.5 million.Officials at the center worry that's an untenable amount for an organization that is now receiving an average of 239 reports a month, compared with 154 during a typical month last year. Out of those, the SafeSport Center has 1,290 open cases, with 2,237 that have been closed. It has 18 investigators and lawyers (with four vacancies) on a staff of 37 (with six vacancies) to handle them. The center projects it will need to double its staff next year and triple it by 2023 to keep up with the work. The stark numbers lend urgency to a fight over who should fund the center in the long term. The USOPC, which founded the center, is pushing the federal government to provide more than what it currently allocates -- a $2.2 million grant spread over three years, none of which can be used for investigations.\"I think it's an 'And' question, not an 'Or' question,\" said USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland, who has been lobbying lawmakers to provide government money to help. She and other leaders are pointing to the model that funds the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency; USADA received about $9.5 million of its $21 million in 2018 revenue from government, an additional $5.1 million from the USOPC and $6.7 million from \"testing and other services,\" according to its annual report.The USOPC brought in around $323 million in revenue in 2018, up from $183 million in '17; the federation's numbers spike in Olympic years and go down during non-Olympic years. It uses the money to support athletes in a number of ways -- including training, insurance, prize money for winners of major events and NGB funding. Last year, to more than 11 percent of total spending ($31.2 million) because of payments to two law firms that did work involving the sex-abuse scandal and severance to former CEO Scott Blackmun.After the center opened in March 2017 it received an initial average of 31 reports a month. That number exploded at the beginning of 2018 when victims of former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar spoke up during his sentencing hearing for sex crimes. By last fall, the number spiked again.It's grown even more in 2019, with each sexual misconduct-related headline triggering more calls.Meanwhile, an independent consultant hired by the center projects the number of calls will continue to increase until it caps at around 8,000 a year -- an average of 667 a month.Center officials said many of the reports could become less complicated as the knowledge from center's education programs seeps into sports communities and issues are reported before they become overly complicated. Eight employees, about one-fifth of the center's workforce, is devoted to education and outreach programs to serve up to 18 million members of national governing bodies across the country. So far, the center has trained about 800,000 of those people.The independent consultant suggested to Colon that, given the workload, the center could use $35 million in 2020. But the center has more modest hopes -- hoping to increase USOPC and NGB donations to bring next year's budget to $16 million.", "tags": ["olympics", "sports", "sex"], "published_time": "2019-09-17 17:37:49", "modified_time": "2019-09-17 18:24:07"}

{"url": ["https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/democrats-push-kavanaugh-impeachment-despite-new-york-times-errors"], "title": "Democrats push Kavanaugh impeachment despite New York Times errors", "content": "Despite major holes in the New York Times story, members of 'The Squad' are calling for Brett Kavanaugh's impeachment and other top Democrats are attacking the FBI's investigation into the allegations; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.'GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she owns a condo in candy land, Dana Perino. \"The Five.\"So it turns out that the writers of that discredited Kavanaugh book have initially included the fact that the victim couldn't recall the alleged incident, that huge story, but the Times took it out of their own article.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think what happened, actually, was that, you know, we had her name and, you know, the Times doesn't usually include the name of the victim. And so, I think in this case the editors felt like maybe it's probably better to remove it. And in removing her name, they removed the other reference to the fact that she didn't remember.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was just sort of editing, you know, done in a haste of -- in the editing process, as you know.(CROSSTALK)(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: So this humongous detail disappeared in the haste of the editing process. That's like saying, in the haste of editing our piece on the maiden voyage of the Titanic in the North Atlantic in 1912, we left out the fact that it sank. This was no error. This was a business decision to turn a nothing burger of a story into sirloin steak. When the victim renounced her own victimhood, they left it out. What's worse, the reporters now blamed the editors and the victim suggesting substance abuse. How do they still have jobs?And what about Christine Ford allies who threatened to smear one witness, Leland Keyser, if she didn't back up her story? That's pretty huge, too. It's witness tampering. Somehow, that got ignored as well. But this is the media. The only reason this hasn't happened to you, dear viewer, is that they don't consider you important enough to destroy. So, in the meantime, they'll target your proxies, Republican, justices, families and businesses of Republicans. They shape the smear first, then they work backwards, erasing any facts that hinder their reverse engineering.And so, Kavanaugh is a rapist becomes a foregone conclusion. In time, they'll do this to you if you ever make their radar, because the institutional media is at panic. They're getting killed, and it's not homicide by Trump. Nope, it's all self-inflicted. Suicide by their own arrogant, dishonest hands.Emily, it's interesting, the reporters, like, gently threw the editors under the bus. And then, when they talked about the victim not corroborating, they're like -- she's probably drunk.EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST: You know what I'm sick of? I'm sick of being taken for an idiot.GUTFELD: That be two.COMPAGNO: In all of this, it's basically like, oh, you, dear viewer, or dear reader, you won't know, you won't care, so why don't you just take what I give you and digest it, right? So then, they say, oh, in the haste of our editing process because the end product is somehow more important than the process of democracy dying in darkness. And I really hate the hypocrisy coming out of the left where, once again, they're telling someone, oh, here honey, this is what happened. But, oh, you know, your struggles with moonshine are the reasons why you can't remember.And then final point, you know, this has created such a ripple effect in terms of sham journalism. Just last month, it was solidified, you know, a now professor, but one of Kavanaugh's classmates, sued the Huffington Post over the article about Georgetown prep being a free for all in a party environment. And their insinuations, or actually there declarations that he provided the drugs that RFK's son O.D. over.And in the retraction and the correction that Huff Po published, they literally defamed him more, and then they have to retract that. And now, their story, by the way, does not even mention the death of David Kennedy and the O.D. in 1984. And so, I think they basically dug a hole even deeper.GUTFELD: You know, Juan, in an effort to get tweeted by Donald Trump, I'm going to say to you that journalism is dead and the New York Times killed it.JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: Yeah, I was listening. I heard you say that in the monologue. And I'm surprise because the New York Times is highly profitable these days.GUTFELD: Oh, yeah, makes a lot of money lying to America.WILLIAMS: Well, but I'm just saying they are --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: I mean, that's a big company.JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Imagine if Hillary been president. It wouldn't be making that much money.WILLIAMS: That's what I think --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Well, Harvey Weinstein would be happy, because that story wouldn't have happened.WATTERS: True.WILLIAMS: Well, I think the Times made a big mistake. I think that's the important point. But I don't think it's an insight into left-wing politics in the country. I mean, to my mind, this was not a coordinated assault, sort of by an all-powerful liberal media institution. You know what? I would say, if that was the case, if they were of that instincts, I think they would have done -- said something about Neil Gorsuch, but they never said anything like that about Gorsuch. They said something about Kavanaugh. And I think the second thing to say --WATTERS: He was the swing vote.COMPAGNO: Right.WILLIAMS: No, I think -- I think that if they -- the idea was, remember, the big upset on the left, Jesse, is that they held that seat, illegitimately, did not allow Merrick Garland a legitimate shot at having - - not only a vote, but simple hearings. So I think if you were saying, oh, yeah, they're gonna attack anybody, they would have attacked him. They did not.So, to me, the real issue is, one, the FBI, again, lack of investigation. We've seen this today, Senator Coons of Delaware, again saying, hey, you should have done something. There was a piece in the Indianapolis papers today by --WATTERS: Done what, Juan?WILLIAMS: I'm sorry.WATTERS: Done what?WILLIAMS: They should have investigated --WATTERS: Investigate what?WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just about to tell you, but you're like interrupting.WATTERS: So just tell me --WILLIAMS: Well, because today there was a professor at the University of Indiana who wrote that he was at Yale at that time. He was -- he contacted the FBI, 25 other people, nobody ever got a response, and now you have people saying, I think Kamala Harris said this. It's necessary to look at the constraints put on the FBI by the White House to limit the investigation and to push Kavanaugh through.GUTFELD: All right.WATTERS: You can't investigate something that no one saw at a place where no one can say where it was at a time that no one can say it happened. And you're saying 25 well-connected Yale graduates can't get the word out in Washington, D.C.? Come on, Juan. I mean, it's ridiculous. It's ridiculous, Juan.Here's the point, I like to congratulate myself for correctly predicting yesterday that the New York Times purposely let this slide, because this was not a mistake, this was unintentionally, and then today, we know was done intentionally by the editors who took it out. So if you're a New York Times editor, here's your thought process, Greg. Anti-Semitic cartoons, that stays in.GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: (INAUDIBLE) against Kavanaugh. No, you got to edit that out. And not only like you've said in the monologue about this woman who was pressured --GUTFELD: Amazing story.WATTERS: -- and threatened to lie to the FBI and say something happened that she didn't believe happened. The guy that is saying that he didn't witness this misconduct, he heard about misconduct, he worked for Bill Clinton. And you know who was on the opposing side of that battle? Brett Kavanaugh during the impeachment battle, because he was on Ken Starr's team. That was also left out of this whole thing.So -- but he wish he kept his calendar from high school because that's the only thing that saved him back then. And the fact that the people are upset about Kavanaugh, yeah, I mean, this is upsetting to him and his family. They do this to Donald Trump every single day. Think about all the things they left out of the Russian collusion story. All of the exculpatory evidence there, Brennan, Clapper, McCabe, all that other nonsense that they never included in their stories until it all imploded. And now they're still looking the other way.GUTFELD: It's true, Dana. I can never look at the New York Times the same way again.DANA PERINO, HOST: Well, you won't have to.GUTFELD: Why?PERINO: Because you have other options --GUTFELD: Do I, really?PERINO: -- because you're an American with lots of options. But I know --GUTFELD: This Leland Keyser story is huge.PERINO: Yeah. But it's also -- it tracks what she said a year ago --GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: -- at the same time, when she was like, well, no, wait. Actually, no. It's almost the exact same story. So, to me, she's obviously telling the truth. When Juan said that this was not an insight into left-wing thinking, I tend disagree, because as soon as that story posted, before any of the corrections, you had several Democratic 2020 candidates saying he must be impeached.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: They can't wait for half a second. So you have to wonder about the judgment. Like, a rush to judgment. How reckless that is. How rash that is, rather than just wait in a second. And as we know, you have to wait and see how these stories go. The other thing I would say about this whole thing is in 2004 and 05 is when -- I believe it was '04 and '05, Brett Kavanaugh was first nominated to the circuit court. In '05, I was one of the spokespeople for it.At the time, it was a very controversial nomination, but it wasn't about any of this. This was never brought up. Not once. And Max Steyer, he'd still gone to school with him.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: What they went after him for in 2005 was torture, and whether he had written a memo along the way that encouraged the president to be like, yes, OK, you can sign off on torture. None of this thing ever came out. I do think that Brett Kavanaugh should sue. And I think he would win. And I think that it would be worthwhile.GUTFELD: Oh, wow.PERINO: How about that?GUTFELD: All right. Well, I think we're going to be talking about this later in the show, Dana.PERINO: Are we?GUTFELD: I think somewhere in the D-block.PERINO: I thought it was a A-block.GUTFELD: No.PERINO: It's right here.GUTFELD: No, but -- no, I'm just teasing, Dana. I was just teasing, damn it.COMPAGNO: I'm so confused.PERINO: It was already 9 --GUTFELD: Yes.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Well, I mean, did I get a chance to talk.WILLIAMS: Well, you did.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But not to -- I'm like -- but I went overtime.GUTFELD: You did a great job, though.PERINO: Now I'm not getting a gold star on my chart.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: All right. President Trump goes after Democrats for saying they want to take your guns. That's next on \"The Five.\"(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: President Trump hitting back hard against Democrats who say they want to take away your guns, 2020 candidate Beto O'Rourke leading the charge. He's refusing to back down after saying he'll confiscate guns. Trump tearing into Beto and others last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: Left-wing Democrats want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your God-given right to self-defense. As your president, I will never allow them to take away your liberty. And I will never, ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And another 2020 Democrat joining the calls for mandatory gun buybacks. Here's Kamala Harris.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: A buyback program is a good idea. Now, we need to do it the right way, and part of that has to be, you know, buyback and give people their value, the financial value of what they have and not just take things from people that have value without compensating them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right. So, Juan, for many, many years, Republicans have said Democrats are coming for your guns. And you guys have been saying, oh, no, that's not true. That's just a right-wing talking point. But now we know it's true, because they are coming for our guns, so what is it like to be wrong?WILLIAMS: I mean, for you?WATTERS: No, you, Juan.WILLIAMS: No, it's not true.WATTERS: What do you mean it's not true? He's just said it's true.WILLIAMS: He said assault weapons. I don't know how many times -- play any tape you want. He says we're coming for --WATTERS: Assault weapons --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Excuse me. Weapons that belongs on a battlefield intended to kill and may. That's what he said.GUTFELD: That's every gun ever made.WATTERS: They carry hand guns in the battlefield too, Juan.WILLIAMS: Yeah. But he didn't say hand guns, he said assault weapons. Look --GUTFELD: So Chicago gangs are safe.WILLIAMS: The American public wants politicians to do something. But there's a disconnect with the politicians at this moment, because the politicians are all trap by the NRA money and medium threats. So, look, here's my thought today, Jesse.WATTERS: OK.WILLIAMS: Obama couldn't do anything about this even after Newtown. You know, Bush couldn't do anything about it. I think Trump has a unique opportunity. His position in terms of his populous appeal and all that, and the fact that he's close to the NRA to actually get something done. He says that he's not going to pick up on the House, the Democratic House passed bill that requires universal background checks.But Mr. Trump, if you would do that, I, Juan Williams, will sing your praise --GUTFELD: Would you vote for him?WILLIAMS: But, I think, you know what? It's like what he did on criminal justice reform, Greg.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: Those other presidents didn't get it done. I think this guy could do something --GUTFELD: I've been saying that forever.WATTERS: So what are the bipartisan ideas on reducing mass shootings that the president could possibly move forward on?GUTFELD: Well, you know, I talked about the civil tag system, which, unfortunately, Beto has totally F-up by making it about him. So he's now saying -- like, when he sees somebody he doesn't like he's gonna call the FBI and say you couldn't have a gun. That feeds into the fears of people who own guns that a civil tag or a red flag system will be used unfairly.I was hoping that wouldn't be the case if you go to a court, you have people who are, you know, health workers or police officers or school principals that are there to talk about the students. Now, what Beto's done is made it sound like, I could just make a phone call and you'd lose your gun.So he -- you know, to get the spotlight for himself, he really screwed up a lot of progress. I also think that there's -- there is progress to be made in cosmetics thing, and cosmetic things that you put onto gun that aren't necessary, that tend to attract a certain type of gun owner. People disagree with me on that, but that's OK. We can discuss it.WILLIAMS: But wait a second. Answer Jesse's question.GUTFELD: I just did.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But seriously. You --GUTFELD: I did, seriously.WILLIAMS: I think it's like 80 or 90 percent say that background checks are cool, 80 or 90 percent say red flags are cool, right? People -- I think it's even most Republicans and most NRA members say all these big magazines with high capacity, we don't need. Would you agree with that?GUTFELD: I just said. Oh, my God. I just talked about the civil taxes that I've been talking about for two years.WILLIAMS: Oh, that's a red-flag stuff.GUTFELD: Yes. And I've also talked about -- recently, I've talked about the whole idea of the cosmetic additions to guns that don't change the power of the gun that maybe attract a certain kind of user.WATTERS: Yeah, because the AR-15, I mean, you really can't hunt with that, because it can barely put down anything. I mean, it's not really that powerful of a gun. But they make much more powerful rifles that could really hurt people that the Democrats don't even talk about. It's just the AR because of the stylizations to make it look militaristic.PERINO: I do think that the White House is trying to figure out a way, what could they propose that would be able to get some bipartisan support? It is a tricky thing. I do think, however -- I don't know if you read the story today that the NRA, that there's concern on Republican -- in Republican circles that the NRA won't be as powerful in terms of get out to vote, because of the troubles that they're having.But the thing is, is that Beto O'Rourke and Kamala Harris, for example, are doing that work for them. Like they --GUTFELD: Yeah.PERINO: -- knew it's already going to energize people to come out to vote. So I do -- and then the president, he might be able to find something to do on background checks, but the devil will definitely be in the details.WATTERS: What do you think about the high-capacity magazines? You know, you have ten in a usual weapon, maybe 30 in a rifle. Do you limit it at 60? Do you limit it at a hundred? Or is that something you think that people could get behind?COMPAGNO: Well, that's interesting. Maybe, I think that might be a regulation that more of a plurality might go for, rather than mandatory confiscation. If I could focus on Kamala Harris, though, for a second, you know, for someone who has had decades of criminal justice experience, I find her over simplification, and also flip-flopping, exhausting, and really confusing. And she started with the take back and then now the buyback, which makes no sense because the government didn't sell it to begin with.But, you know, she builds herself out as a, quote, progressive prosecutor. But when she was California's A.G., it was status quo. And under her reign, there were a lot of -- frankly, atrocities that happened that now she has distanced herself from, right? The Supreme Court said you're overcrowding in California is literally cruel and unusual.Prison labor, all of these things, and she came out and defended it by saying I wasn't behind offices messaging. I literally had no idea. I find that either inadequate or incompetent. And so, for me, coming from California, and with also a criminal justice background, that's why I wanted to take this moment to highlight her jumping on this bandwagon, which I think is ineffective. And I don't think it's energizing the base. I think it's simply rhetoric that people who take it one step further and think about policy realize it's totally ineffective.WATTERS: And by the way, Kamala is now losing in California to Andrew Yang. I just thought all of you should know that at home. Liberal insanity hitting new levels, one major city allowing students to ditch school to protest climate change, and it plan to crack down on chocolate milk.GUTFELD: Chocolate milk.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: The largest school district in the country stirring up controversy with two new plans. First, New York City is letting its 1.1 million students skip classes this Friday to protest climate change. Public school officials saying they'll excused at absences for those who'll attend for global youth climate strike.And the big apple has a bold new proposal to fight obesity. They want to ban chocolate milk. The city's department of education is reportedly thinking about cutting out the lunch time staple. They're concerned of its high sugar content. Jesse, do you love chocolate milk?WATTERS: I love it. And I'm going to chug it on the next break.(LAUGHTER)WATTERS: But, I mean, they have other things to worry about. Maybe make them go to gym class instead of skipping the chocolate milk. But about the protests, I mean, if we only have ten years left on planet earth, Juan, why are the kids in school anyway?GUTFELD: True.WATTERS: We're all gonna die. Why don't they just go hang out with their parents? You only have a few years left. I mean, think about it logically. AOC says Miami is going to be underwater in a few years. Why don't we just move to higher ground as Andrew Yang said? It's very simple. And the point of skipping school is to draw attention to the climate issue, so all these foreign leaders when they're here for the U.N. General Assembly, can see that it's a big issues.So they think that President Xi of China really cares what a bunch of high school freshmen from the lower eastside think about anything? He doesn't even listen to his own citizens in his own country. So, at this point, there's no Vietnam War. There's no civil rights issue. So they don't have anything to protest. They're protesting the weather. But I do have an admission, Juan.WILLIAMS: What's that?WATTERS: If I was in high school, if I got to get out of math, I'd protest anything.WILLIAMS: You go.WATTERS: Yeah. Meat, men, Trump, I'm out.WILLIAMS: So, Dana, it's not mandatory, right? And I've noticed that a lot of the private schools, they're even more enthusiastic about letting kids to go to this because they say it's learning outside the classroom.PERINO: That's what Saturdays are for. No, honestly --WATTERS: Saturdays are for the boys.PERINO: OK. So maybe after school activities. As a taxpayer, I want children in school to succeed beyond their wildest dreams. I want them to have every opportunity. Not going to school to protest climate change is not going to get them there. And I just think as a taxpayer, I'm irritated.And for the chocolate milk, you've seen the size of the chocolate milk that you get at school? It's like this big.WATTERS: That's true.PERINO: It's not -- we have this gigantic glass right here. It's like four of those in one. So I don't like the government getting too involved. But I really, really hate the glorification of these children led by the young lady from Denmark of getting out of going to school, and therefor now she's a big hero? I think that's a terrible, terrible idea. Private schools, knock yourselves out.WILLIAMS: So, Greg, I was just thinking to myself, you know, for the kids, it's not really left or right. Apparently, a high percentage of the kids say they're worried about climate change. And then you get people like, you know, the hunters, right? The hunters like the environment because they go hunting. Or the evangelicals where the bible says you should be a good --GUTFELD: I like what you're going there, Juan. And I don't buy it.WILLIAMS: That's why I'm doing it.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: I know. OK. You could argue this is child abuse by forcing children to worry about something to a point where they're actually in some kind of psychological panic. You could say that. If you agree with this idea that you can take off school for climate change, then let's substitute the cost with one that you're not -- that's not your ideological cup of tea, right?Maybe you want to protest going to school because it's not a gun -- it's because it's a gun-free zone. Therefore, you, as a parent, or your kids don't feel safe in a school because it's a gun-free zone, therefore we want to take that day off. Right now, you know, every liberal -- their head would explode. Or maybe because of lack of school prayer. Maybe you want to take school off and protest lack of school prayer. Of course you're not OK with that.So the point is, this is all about ideology that you should be against this no matter what it is. You can protest -- you don't want to have boys and girls bathrooms. You could protest that, too. But you're not. So here's the thing. If I were a teacher and you didn't show up for that, I would flunk you. I would flunk you. And as for the chocolate milk, why aren't they doing this with white milk?WATTERS: Oh, that's racist.GUTFELD: Yes, racism.WILLIAMS: Wait, wait, I think it has more sugar.WATTERS: Yeah, white milk matters, Juan.COMPAGNO: That's a joke.GUTFELD: White privilege.WILLIAMS: So, Emily I was trying to make--GUTFELD: Lactose intolerant.WILLIAMS: Greg didn't like my point about the evangelical. But my thought is you know the reason that we can't seem to come together on climate change is big oil, the big fossil fuel industry, the money they put into it.PERINO: No, no.WILLIAMS: And the climate change deniers. So, what's wrong.WATTERS: Deniers.GUTFELD: That was fantastic.COMPAGNO: Sure. I hear what you're saying. On chocolate milk, I had it every day in public school from kindergarten through fifth grade and I think I turned out just fine. That's number one.Number two, so back to that for a second. And just on the kid's component of it. I'm from the Bay as everybody knows. And so, in fourth grade, we were shown how to protest, and we staged a sit in in the office and I remember being so excited about it.GUTFELD: Yes.COMPAGNO: I learned the importance of a certain element of civil.GUTFELD: You get detention.COMPAGNO: Of civic disruption and what that means to be able to exercise this right. And I remember feeling so - just learning the gravitas of it and it was awesome. This is not that. You know the New York Post editorial board to me called it for what it was which is out and out government sponsorship of a particular point of view.WATTERS: Citing the New York Post editorial board, I like that.PERINO: I was impressed.WILLIAMS: Dana, can you give her the gold star?PERINO: Yes, you can have mine since I flunked A blog. But can I say something about - I think it's unfair to all of us. And I mean Left and Right to just say that this is just a fossil fuel problem. There are - the fossil fuel companies are actually putting a ton of money into innovations to try to find alternatives because they realize it. America is actually in a better position now from a safety and security standpoint because we have figured out innovations in fracking being one of them.In addition, there was a great new story today, one of the things that puts out more greenhouse gas emissions than anything else is the production of cement. And today at MIT labs they were going to reveal that there is a new way of actually making cement that will actually capture all of those greenhouse gases.So, innovation is the key to this. We're not going to basically protest our way out of it. If you're not going to school is not going to help you invent the next big thing.WILLIAMS: Right. But I think big oil puts a lot of money into saying no, not a problem.PERINO: I don't think they do it anymore.WILLIAMS: I think that's - those are the largest point about--GUTFELD: That's old fake news.WILLIAMS: Oh! stop. All right. More on the New York Times Brett Kavanaugh controversy. President Trump's fiery response to the Times. That's all here when \"The Five\" comes right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: President lashing out at Democrats for their latest attempt to take down Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The Left tries to threaten, bully, intimidate Americans into submission. They use Democrat prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can. They'll do whatever they can to demean you, to libel you. They try to blacklist, coerce, cancel or destroy anyone who gets in their way. Look at what they're doing today to Justice Kavanaugh. They say, let's impeach Justice Kavanaugh. Let's impeach him. It's a made up story.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Despite major holes in the New York Times story, Democrats including members of The Squad are calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment and other top Democrats are attacking the FBI's investigation into the allegations.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The FBI investigation was deeply disappointing and troubling. They did not conduct what I would consider a by the book background investigation.HARRIS: That was a part of that hearing and a sham process. I knew that there were credible allegations that should have been investigated that were not.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The FBI was straight jacketed. And there is a need for investigation now because there never was then.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Emily, help us understand how do you investigate something like this when the people are saying that they don't remember it and they don't believe it and it wasn't them and it wasn't there. Like what do you investigate?COMPAGNO: Well, that's why I find it so hard to even, when people are clamoring and saying the investigation wasn't conducted or that it was and it stopped at the game of telephone which was it is not a corroboration when someone just says something that they heard from the same person that you originally heard about.It doesn't make sense, it's not logical. That's not evidence. And playing the judge, jury and executioner as Kamala Harris and the other 2020 presidential candidates like to do doesn't restore my faith that they're actually going to uphold the process and that you know I think the President is right here. That is exactly what the Left is doing, and you know Judge Clarence Thomas in 1991, he said to a friend, the reason that he got confirmed is because African-Americans remain too loyal to him. This was his quote.And he said that in 15 to 20 years, I predict that I will lose that support and I will fall into disfavor because the special interest liberal groups will stop at nothing to get their way and to get that message across and the same thing is happening now with Kavanaugh,PERINO: What do you think of that, Juan. Because you know Justice Thomas.WILLIAMS: I think - I know a lot about this and so it's hard for me to talk without - but I just think that there was a sense right at the time that the black community was initially supportive of Justice Thomas and that it was once you had a lot of people who were concerned about the abortion issue, pressure fellow liberal or Left wing groups, however you want to - that then you saw some of the black leadership begin to back away.PERINO: I seeWILLIAMS: But let me just come back to this discussion that we're having. Now, the first thing to say is that obviously and I had said this in the first segment. There are people - 25 plus people who say I tried to reach out to the FBI, they never get back to me. So, it's not a matter of phone call, Emily, it's like hey, if you're going to investigate, don't put a time constraint. Don't say don't go beyond this period. Let them investigate.GUTFELD: They did.WILLIAMS: But they didn't obviously.GUTFELD: Yes, they did.WILLIAMS: But the second point I want to make is this. It is so rich to me to hear a fact challenged Donald Trump say somebody else distorted a story. I mean the New York Times took responsibility. They ran an editor's note that said, we should have put this information in the story. They've demoted editors for bad tweets. CNN has fired reporters for erroneous stories--PERINO: OK. So far, Greg there hasn't been anything.GUTFELD: They've done nothing. Saying a correction isn't enough. I mean I'm sorry. And to Trump's point again, this is the expanding target of demonization. Going after Trump is not enough. You go after the family. You go after the business owners who support Trump. You go after people in red hats who are just going to work. This is what they do.And it goes back to what I said yesterday. Their tactics were exposed by outsiders. And it makes you wonder how many stories in New York Times, how many stories in The Washington Post that ruin people's lives were also corrupted. That's what I said like I don't trust anything anymore. And maybe that is the great service of the last three years.Well, I just wondered, should we be looking at all of these other stories to find out how many people got screwed. How many people got destroyed because there weren't any Motley Hemingway's around to like check on it.WATTERS: Yes. The Democrats used to win elections. I mean the last 10 presidential elections, Democrats won four, Republicans won six. So, it makes me think, do they know something the Democrats that we don't know. Do they know they can't win in 2020 or are they looking at the polling, the map, the fundraising, the match ups and deep down they know they have to cheat and smear and lie and deceive and do all sorts of these para military political maneuvers in order to take this guy out.It reminds me Juan of the Tyson-Holyfield fight. Tyson was losing. He knows he was going to lose. He bites Holyfield's ear in order to get decued and that's how that thing went down. And right now, that's what the Democrats are doing. They're boycotting. They're blacklisting. They're smearing. You have the insurance policy. You have the witch hunt.All of these shady dirty tricks they're trying to pull. You're chasing people out of restaurants, so they know what I do now, when I eat at a liberal establishment, I order the entrees first because that way if they chase me out, I already have a full stomach. I'm good.GUTFELD: That's amazing logic, Jesse.WATTERS: It's true. Entrees the dessert, then the appetizer if I have been chased out.WILLIAMS: But you should get dessert first, man you deserve dessert first.WATTERS: Only if it's chocolate milk.WILLIAMS: By the way, who did the Clintons are up to pedophilia and led to a shooting a pizza guy, who said oh, Uranium One. I think there are a lot of conservative websites that never ever take responsibility and account for mistakes.WATTERS: No one got locked up and no one was called the Russian agent.PERINO: You had Uranium One on your five bingo cards today.WATTERS: And it came out of Juan's mouth.GUTFELD: Take it out.PERINO: All right. Sean Spicer in a puffy lime green shirt making a splash on Dancing With The Stars. How did he do, find out next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COMPAGNO: It's the moment we've all been waiting for. Despite backlash and boycott threats, Sean Spicer made his big debut on Dancing With The Stars. He didn't disappoint with neon green ruffles and busting out salsa moves to the Spice Girls. How appropriate?(VIDEO PLAYING)COMPAGNO: OK, see you guys, I honestly never watch that show. I'm not a fan, but my mom is like the biggest fan in the world and so I asked her what she thought of his performance and she said, he was fun to watch. He kept smiling and tried hard, tolerable dancing but remember I enjoy the personality as much as the dancing, watching them evolve and improve. It's the heart of the show. No one starts perfect, but I feel like she's a harsh critic and so that was so favorable. WATTERS: Well, mom texts is my territory. Stay out of that.COMPAGNO: That was fun though.WATTERS: You know I found out something that I didn't know that he actually picked that shirt. COMPAGNO: Really?WATTERS: That was an option and he chose that option. I thought ABC gave to him to wear.PERINO: Forced him.WATTERS: To humiliate him, because he is a Trump Republican press secretary. No. He did that to himself. And I'm also surprised at this. He beat Lamar Odom. A white Republican from Rhode Island beat Lamar Odom. I did not see that coming.COMPAGNO: Also, you don't know what the other options were. So, if he picked it like maybe the other options were worst.WATTERS: Could you imagine what else was on the table.COMPAGNO: Exactly. So, what do you think, Juan, redemption for Sean in the public's eyes?WILLIAMS: I think that segment was the most watched segment in the history of television. Look, I think he did fine. In fact, he exceeded my expectations, so hats off. I think he earned his money. Remember you were saying he was doing this for money.WATTERS: Yes.WILLIAMS: I think he earned the money.WATTERS: Every penny.WILLIAMS: But I do think he should keep his day job.WATTERS: Which is Fox News Contributor?WILLIAMS: No, he used to be a press secretary.WATTERS: No, not yet. Sorry about that Sean.PERINO: Press secretary. And Sean Spicer will be on the story tonight with Martha MacCallum, so people could see more about him. I think he's a great sport. He is. He loves life. He's a terrific husband and father. I would never ever, ever be able to do this. Last night, I participated in a roast of Ben Shapiro. I was such a ball of nerves like almost crumpled under the table with nerves just for that. So, I could never have done what Sean did.COMPAGNO: You were literally going to get an invitation for this tonight.WATTERS: Wait, there is a Ben Shapiro roast?PERINO: There was last night.WATTERS: I've got to get my hands on that tape.COMPAGNO: Was it fun after though at least.PERINO: I was glad it was over, yes.WATTERS: Who was the worst? Who really gave it to him badly?PERINO: Well, I think that's different like, give it him badly means that you did a good job.WATTERS: Right. I know what a roast does.PERINO: I'm not going to say.WATTERS: OK. All right.PERINO: I'll tell you on a commercial break.WATTERS: All right.COMPAGNO: Greg, do you think that this helps round out Sean to the public that really demonized him for so long?GUTFELD: I don't know if he needs to be rounded out.WATTERS: Greg.GUTFELD: It just remind me of the world's worst cruise ship entertainment. If I was on that ship, I would have jumped, taken my family with me and no one would convict me. It would have been a mercy killing. You know you aren't getting paid for your time or for your work there, you're getting paid to be humiliated. That is a lifelong meme.I will never do that, and I have friends, I like to think of you people as friends. You're my friends, right. So, if I ever consider this, I want you to drag me out into some room, drug me for six months, get me hooked on something. So, I completely forget about this, because that's what friends do for friends. They prevent them from making asses of themselves on TV.PERINO: I promise I'll never let you do \"Dancing with the Stars.\"GUTFELD: Yes.WATTERS: Do you think Ryan said, Sean, no dancing.GUTFELD: Don't do that. You're now a lifelong meme.COMPAGNO: I feel like this. This kind of show is like a wedding where everyone takes their cue from the bride and he looked like he was having a blast. And I'm sure he was. And so, I do feel like people see that authenticity so rather than seeing him as annoying like I just I think that's classic, good for him.GUTFELD: I would do that for $25 million. OK. Nothing less. And I'd also use that money, I'd go to an island. I would get some plastic surgery.PERINO: Would you be able to get some crew neck sweaters.GUTFELD: Yes, crew neck sweaters. I would create a race of Monster dogs or sloths. And I would never come back.COMPAGNO: But Greg, no one wants to see grumpy cat dance. Like no one wants to see grumpy cat dance, like we want to see Sean, because he was having such a great time.GUTFELD: Did you call me a grumpy cat.COMPAGNO: Yes.GUTFELD: You know I can get--COMPAGNO: One More Thing is up next.GUTFELD: I can get you out of here.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: All right. Time for One More Thing. Let's do this. OK. Animals Are Great. Never ends. I do this simply to inflict suffering on my panelists. You know sometimes I just feel like a dirty bird.PERINO: Oh! Wow.GUTFELD: Yes. Dirty Bird. The only thing I could do is a dirty bird get under that faucet and let the warm water hit my belly like this little fellow here. Look at that. He knows how to get clean. Obviously, he did something earlier in the day. And he can't seem to wash it off. Some kind of moral failing that that bird has. God knows what he did to a worm, to another worm.WATTERS: Jesus.GUTFELD: My God, it's disgusting what he did. Anyway, that's why, Animals Are Great. Funny thing, the bird was Spicer shirt. All right, Dana that's you.PERINO: All right. So, a Montana grandmother took the law into her own hands as well as a hair dryer. So, Patti Baumgartner wanted the cars in her town to slow down, she's like sick of it, she can't take it anymore. She wants her grandkids and everyone else in the neighborhood to be safe, so she armed herself with her blow dryer pose like a police officer with a radar gun and her son showed the photos of the mom online, got the attention of the highway patrol.Noah Pesola and he tracked down Patti and made her an honorary trooper for her efforts. He said that Montana has a speeding issue and her creative response has helped draw attention to the problem.GUTFELD: She should be arrested for impersonating an officer. Mandatory five years in jail. All right, Juan.WILLIAMS: All right. So, this must be bird Tuesday, because I've got a bird story for you Greg. Have you ever played Angry Birds? Well, guess what happened to Representative Jaime Andrade who is pushing for removal of pigeons from overhead rail tracks in Chicago. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAIME ANDRADE JR., LEGISLATOR: Did I just get - I just have to go and clean it up and that's what happens to my constituents. They get shit on all the time.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: All right. Representative Andrade is upset because his constituents are getting bird waste and feathers on their clothes, their shoes and of course their heads. But city of Chicago and Chicago transit, they haven't done anything and now the Angry Birds are taking it out on the Representative who is trying to toss them out of their roost. Watch out for those angry birds.GUTFELD: Well, you know pigeon poop is high in vitamin E. I bet you didn't know that.PERINO: You can vape it.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: I hope you don't know that from experience.GUTFELD: I am making it up. Jesse.PERINO: And I was kidding.WATTERS: Mentioned poop today. We'd like to wish our Executive Producer Megan Albano a very happy birthday. I'm the one that deliver that news, because I am her favorite host.GUTFELD: Wait a minute, is that why she's not here today. Did she take today off because it's her birthday? You know how I feel about that.PERINO: I don't know.GUTFELD: All right.WATTERS: Did I just out her. Anyway, it also coincides with a very other special day, National Indoor Plant Day. In an honor of that, I'd like to update with you might with my bonsai tree news.PERINO: This is crazy.WATTERS: Which I have here. You may recall that I have a bonsai tree in my office. I was very enamored with the tree once it was behind the Trump Tucker interview in Japan. So, I've got it for myself, but now it's dying.PERINO: It looks off today.WATTERS: And it looks dry and it's discolored. So, I think my assistant Johnny is watering it too much, it could be a case of over watering. But we're going to continue to provide updates on the tree as they develop.GUTFELD: I'll give you my advice, fire your assistant. This is totally unacceptable. Emily.COMPAGNO: No, I stand with Johnny OK you guys, I am so excited about this One More Thing.GUTFELD: How can we tell.COMPAGNO: Castle which is the setting for Downtown Abbey and don't forget this Friday, the movie is coming out. On October 1st, a reservation slot will open up for two guests, two commoners to actually stay there.WATTERS: Commoners.COMPAGNO: As an Airbnb for one night stay on November 26th.GUTFELD: One night stand.WATTERS: One night stand.GUTFELD: Jesus.COMPAGNO: No, one night stay I said. Now I lost my train of thought. Anyway, it's going to be totally amazing, you literally going to hang out with the lord and lady of the Manor, the real Earl and Countess of Carnarvon and you get a traditional dinner. You got a private tour. I mean it's going to be amazing. I'm sure they have a million, because remember in the beginning of Downtown Abbey it was the white lab that it shows. I'm obviously submitting myself for that.GUTFELD: Well, you know what--COMPAGNO: I probably won't get picked.WATTERS: Like a commoner, typical.GUTFELD: Set your DVRs.

{"url": ["https://www.foxnews.com/politics/combative-lewandowski-frustrates-democrats-as-impeachment-related-hearing-descends"], "title": "Combative Lewandowski frustrates Democrats, as impeachment-probe hearing descends into disarray", "content": "Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski delivers opening statement before House Judiciary Committee.The House Judiciary Committee's first hearing as part of its Trump descended into chaos Tuesday as Democrats clashed with a combative , trading insults and accusations with the former Trump campaign manager, who refused to answer many of their questions.After five hours of testimony before lawmakers, the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, told Lewandowski his \"behavior in this hearing room has been completely unacceptable,\" and said holding him \"in contempt\" is \"certainly under consideration.\"Lewandowski immediately frustrated Nadler, the committee's chairman, during the Democrat's first question earlier in the day - when the witness, in an apparent effort to stall for time, repeatedly asked Nadler to point to the specific section in the Robert Mueller report related to his question. Lewandowski was following White House orders not to discuss confidential conversations with the president beyond what was already public in the former special counsel's report.Asked by Nadler if he met alone with President Donald Trump in June 2017, Lewandowski said, \"Could you read the exact language of the report? I don't have it available to me.\"\"I don't think I need to do that,\" Nadler shot back. \"I have limited time.\"Asked the question again, Lewandowski told Nadler he needed him to \"refresh\" his memory of what was in the report. He demanded that Democrats provide him a copy of the report, sending Democratic staff scrambling to find one.\"He's filibustering,\" a frustrated Nadler said.Amid the back-and-forth, the top Republican on the committee, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, moved to adjourn the hearing, forcing a failed voice vote that caused further delay, before questioning resumed from other lawmakers.Lewandowski later declined to play along with certain questions. New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries asked Lewandowski if he was Trump's \"hitman, the bag man, the lookout, or all of the above?\"\"I think I'm the good looking man, actually,\" Lewandowski replied.Lewandowski is considering a run for the Senate in New Hampshire in 2020. In a reminder of the political backdrop, during a recess, the witness tweeted out a link to a website promoting his possible candidacy. And Democrats referenced his ambitions.\"You are not on the campaign trail yet,\" Jeffries said. \"This is the House Judiciary Committee. Act like you know the difference.\"There were fireworks from the beginning. Nadler opened by saying the hearing is part of efforts to \"determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment with respect to President Trump.\" He railed against the White House's efforts to block the testimony of two other former Trump aides -- Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter -- who did not show up on orders from the administration.\"This is a cover-up, plain and simple,\" Nadler said of the White House's efforts to block testimony from Dearborn and Porter.At another point, Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee told Lewandowski, \"You are obviously here to block any reasonable inquiry into the truth or not of this administration.\"Lewandowski fired back that he was unable to give her a response because it wasn't a question but a \"rant.\"During his questioning, Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson said, \"Mr. Lewandowski, you are like a fish being cleaned with a spoon -- it's very hard to get an answer out of you.\"Lewandowski appeared to mock California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell's unsuccessful bid for the White House earlier this year, calling him \"President Swalwell\" at one point during questioning. Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline suggested that the committee hold Lewandowski in contempt over his refusal to cooperate with Democratic questions.Democrats repeatedly asked questions about Mueller's report, which said Trump asked Lewandowski to direct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit Mueller's investigation. The report said Trump said that if Sessions would not meet with Lewandowski, then Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired. Lewandowski never delivered the message but asked Dearborn, a former Sessions aide, to do it. Dearborn said he was uncomfortable with the request and declined to deliver it, according to the report.Tennessee Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen -- who once brought a bucket of fried chicken to a hearing after Attorney General Bill Barr did not show up for it -- suggested to Lewandowski that he \"chickened out.\" During another exchange, Lewandowski replied that he did not, and claimed he went on a family vacation.In his opening statement, Lewandowski railed against the Trump investigations.\"It is now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda - to try and take down a duly elected president of the United States,\" he said. \"As for actual collusion or conspiracy, there was none. What there has been, however, is harassment of this president from the day he won the election.\"The president was apparently watching, and tweeted: \"Such a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you Corey!\"Meanwhile, Republicans mocked the hearing, with a fired-up ranking member Collins dismissing it as \"re-run season,\" saying the committee's previous hearing with Mueller didn't \"go well.\" Collins dismissed the Democrats' effort to seek impeachment, saying, \"You don't have the votes.\"Mueller found that there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia, but reached no conclusion on obstruction of justice. Barr later made his own decision on obstruction, saying there was insufficient evidence.After lawmakers finished their inquiries Tuesday, Lewandowski was questioned into the early evening by Democratic counsel Barry Berke. Republicans on the committee decried the move of bringing in Berke, who was hired as a consultant and is not on the committee staff.\"This move to have private consultants question a witness during an oversight hearing is an egregious violation of the Rules of the House and pretends that the Judiciary Committee's Article I oversight authority extends to private attorneys when it doesn't,\" Collins said in a statement. \"I cannot believe that Judiciary Democrats are outsourcing their pseudo-impeachment inquiry to paid consultants.\"The hearing underscores what has been a central dilemma for House Democrats all year -- they have promised to investigate Trump, aggressively, and many of their base supporters want them to move quickly to try to remove him from office. But the White House has blocked their oversight requests at most every turn, declining to provide new documents or allow former aides to testify.The Republican Senate is certain to rebuff any House efforts to bring charges against the president. And moderate Democrats in their own caucus have expressed nervousness that the impeachment push could crowd out their other accomplishments.Still, the Judiciary panel is moving ahead, approving rules for impeachment hearings last week.", "tags": ["russia-investigation", "politics", "donald-trump", "democrats"], "published_time": "2019-09-17 14:19:51", "modified_time": "2019-09-17 18:54:54"}

When calls began to circulate for him to step down, he and said he did not believe it was him in the photo on his yearbook page.His med school alma mater then launched an investigation to determine the identity of the men in the photo among other breaches of protocol that allowed the photo to be printed. They hired McguireWoods law firm to conduct the investigation. The firm spent 727 hours and reported an inconclusive determination of who appeared in the photo from 1984. Invoices reveal they charged the school almost $400,000.The school had been trying to determine who was in the photo, how the photo passed editorial standards to appear on the yearbook page and whether offensive material appeared in other yearbooks, according to a May report obtained by Fox News.McguireWoods contacted more than 80 current and former EVMS students dating back to 1983 and interviewed 30, including current and former faculty, students and staff. They interviewed current presidents of the student body and student government association, as well as five members of the 1984 yearbook staff. The 36-page-report presented to the public on May 21, said there was not enough information to \"conclusively determine the identity of either individual depicted in the photograph.\"It did determine that the blackface photo featured on Northam's page was no anomaly-- there were three such photos in the 1984 yearbook. In total, there were 10 blackface photos featured in EVMS yearbooks from 1976 to 2013.Northam's political action committee also hired a law firm to investigate the photo, which hired a biometrics and forensics company to perform a facial recognition test of the photo, but the company said it was \"not of a quality for a comparison to be conducted.\"The report did reveal that EVMS president Richard Homan knew about the photograph while Northam was running for office and decided not to make it public.The firm had tasked nine people with working on the investigation and billed the school between $265 and $575 per hour, The Virginian-Pilot. The work began three days after the photo surfaced, Feb. 4, and concluded on June 24.Homan could not immediately be reached for comment, but he told the in May the intent of the investigation was to \"discover what, if any, administrative oversight was exercised.\"Northam, upon recanting his apology and saying he does not believe he appeared in the photo, admitted to darkening his face to dress up as Michael Jackson that same year. \"You remember these things,\" Northam said, according to the report. He also said he was slim when he was young, and the person in the photograph is thicker than Northam remembers being. The man in the photograph is holding a beer in his right hand, and Northam claimed he would usually hold a beer in his left hand.", "tags": ["ralph-northam", "us", "virginia"], "published_time": "2019-09-17 16:24:21", "modified_time": "2019-09-17 16:56:07"}

The White House is not objecting to his appearance but has instructed him not to answer questions about his communications with the president. (See the of White House counsel Pat Cipollone to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.)This raises an interesting question: May the president assert executive privilege to shield disclosure of his communications with people who are not part of the White House staff and the broader executive branch?Lewandowski was not a government official in June and July 2017, when, according to the , the president instructed him to convey a directive to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The directive was for Sessions to narrow his recusal from the Russia investigation so that he could limit then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's jurisdiction - such that Mueller could investigate only to prevent Russian meddling in future elections.That is, Mueller would end his probe of Kremlin interference in the 2016 campaign, on the rationale that Trump had done nothing wrong. Sessions was to add that he had been with Trump for nine months on the campaign and therefore knew that \"there were no Russians involved with him.\"The last claim was an overstatement. We now know that the Trump organization was involved in negotiations for Trump Tower Moscow throughout the 2016 campaign. Moreover, while there is no evidence that candidate Trump himself was informed about the matter, his top campaign officials (his son Don Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his then-campaign manager Paul Manafort) met in June 2016 with a lawyer they understood to be a Kremlin emissary (Natalia Veselnitskaya, with an entourage of Russians in tow) in the expectation (unfulfilled) of receiving campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton.Ironically, as I further detail in \",\" Veselnitskaya obtained the materials she presented from Fusion GPS, the same outfit that was working for Clinton to scrounge up campaign dirt on Donald Trump Russian sources.", "tags": ["russia-investigation", "opinion", "robert-mueller", "democrats"], "published_time": "2019-09-17 16:09:51", "modified_time": "2019-09-17 16:33:03"}

The authentic-looking cartridges are sold by unlicensed dispensaries and delivery services, along with rogue websites.The problem has gotten so pervasive that a major legal brand, Kingpen, is investing millions of dollars to redesign its packaging and product security, AP has learned.The distributor for another major brand, Heavy Hitters, devotes a section of its website to report phonies and has hired a former federal prosecutor, Priya Sopori, to help the company deal with counterfeiting.\"The danger presented by counterfeit products is just a natural result of not having the money, the resources or the people power to enforce licensing,\" Sopori said. \"Someone is buying this packaging, buying these cartridges and filling them with whatever. It's being sold as our brand.\"As marijuana has gone mainstream, versions of e-cigarettes that vaporize high-inducing cannabis oil are one of the hottest-selling items, popular for those who don't want the smoke that comes from lighting up a joint. In addition to quickly delivering a high, there's a perception -- not supported by science -- that vaping is a healthier alternative to smoking.In California's legal market, the world's largest, the state requires cannabis oil to be tested before being placed on the shelf for sale. For example, safety checks are made for the presence of 66 pesticides, mercury, lead and other heavy metals, and 21 solvents that could be used in the extraction process, when oil is pulled from cannabis.But it can be hard for consumers to tell whether a product they're buying is made by a legitimate company. The phony packaging is convincing to the untrained eye, some even carrying bogus labels that appear to carry state-required test results. Most consumers probably wouldn't know the difference -- until they vape it. The taste and THC level could be significantly different from the authentic product.To add to the confusion, consumers can have trouble distinguishing legal dispensaries from unlicensed shops, which in Los Angeles sometimes operate in the same neighborhoods and appear indistinguishable.\"My biggest fear of counterfeiting is people are getting an unsafe product, and illegal product, and think it's coming from our company, a legal company,\" says Bryce Berryessa, a board member of the California Cannabis Manufacturers Association whose company, Skunk Feather, produces concentrates and vape cartridges.In light of the vaping-related illness, the to avoid vaping products that contain THC.

I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"Secretary of State Pompeo is heading to Saudi Arabia today, as the White House says evidence clearly points Iran as the likely culprits in that drone attack on Saudi oil facilities. Iran continues to deny it.Oil prices, which surged 15 percent after the attack yesterday, dropping more than 5 percent today. The big question now is, how should the United States respond?Kentucky Senator Rand Paul on that in just a moment, but first John Roberts at the White House with the very latest -- John.JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Charles, good afternoon to you.And one of the reasons why those oil prices are coming down is because the Saudi oil minister today said that 50 percent of the production that was taken offline by the attacks has been restored and that the oil facilities will be back up to full production by the end of this month, and already export levels are already back to where they were prior to the attack.Now, U.S. and Saudi teams are on the ground at the two oil-producing facilities collecting pieces of the missiles that were involved in the attack U.S. officials tell FOX News there is high confidence that the cruise missiles and drones were launched from Southwest Iran and not Yemen, as Iran has claimed.President Trump still has not definitively declared that Iran was behind the attacks. But speaking at the Heritage Foundation this morning, the vice president, Mike Pence, mirroring the president's tough talk over the weekend. Listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT: As the president said, we don't want war with anybody.But the United States is prepared. We're locked and loaded. And we're ready to defend our interests and our allies in the region, make no mistake about it.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: As you said at the top, Charles, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, will be in Saudi Arabia tomorrow for discussions with Saudi officials.They will likely go over the evidence that has been collected at the oil facilities and determine what steps will come next.President Trump yesterday suggested that any military action would be proportional, likely targeting a similar Iranian oil facility. Iran has been warning about any attack, saying that there are several U.S. military bases that are within range of their intermediate-range missiles. That would be to a range of about 1,300 miles.President Trump still has not ruled out meeting with the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani next week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, though it does appear unlikely.Aboard Air Force One, speaking with the press corps, the president said: \"I never rule anything out, but I prefer not meeting him\" -- Charles.PAYNE: John Roberts, thank you very much.So, when it comes to Iran, how should the United States proceed?With me now, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.Senator, thanks for joining us.SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Thanks for having me.PAYNE: So, a lot of controversy in the Republican circles -- not controversy, but certainly debate, if you will, on whether or not this rises to the threshold for American military involvement.What are your thoughts?PAUL: Well, I think it's always important to keep the Constitution in mind.The Constitution says that war is declared by Congress, not by the president. So, really, any kind of military action where we would bomb or target targets in a foreign land would have to be approved by Congress in advance. They don't just happen.Presidents can respond in self-defense, but we're talking about days to weeks later. And this wasn't an attack really on the U.S., remember. It was an attack on Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia is saying that the weapons are Iranian. And I really trust that that probably is going to be true. But the question of where the attack came from, whether it came from Iran or whether it came from Iraq or it came from Yemen, I don't think I have seen incontrovertible evidence yet.People are leaning one way or the other. But, really, I think there needs to be a thorough investigation of this. And if the U.S. is going to ally with Saudi Arabia and join a war with Iran, that's a big step.And Congress needs to debate this. And Congress needs to decide whether or not we're going to be at war with Iran or not.PAYNE: And, with all due respect, I think most of our viewers agree with the idea that this is all covered in the Constitution.And yet, in practice, presidents have OKed the kind of actions that Vice President Pence just described, a surgical, precise retaliatory attack, not on the Iranian people or Iran itself, but certainly facilities that would sort of counterbalance the damage that was done over the weekend.You would be opposed to that?PAUL: I would be always in favor of adhering to the Constitution. I took an oath to the Constitution, and the oath very specific. The Constitution is very specific.In fact, Madison, when describing the Constitution, said that, with very studied care, we took that power because the executive branch was most prone to war, and we vested that power in the legislature.All of the founding fathers were very, very clear. The Federalist Papers are very, very clear. The president doesn't get to declare a war. Whether it's a president I like or one I don't like from my party or another party, the power to go to war is vested in Congress.And I will adhere to that and fight for that principle.PAYNE: If we were to go through the appropriate process, however, and it was proven that these were Iranian weapons launched in the country of Iran, and that there needed to be some sort of pushback against an ever more belligerent, provocative Iran, would you would be willing to say, OK, in this particular case, we need to send a message?PAUL: Well, one, I would need to know more evidence about exactly where the weapons were launched from. And we need to have a debate over that and look at the intelligence.But, two, we have to ask a question. There's a war going on in Yemen. The war is a war between Saudi Arabia and her allies on one side of Yemen, and then the Houthis and their Iranian allies on the other. There's been atrocities committed on both sides. There are -- it's a humanitarian nightmare.PAYNE: Right.PAUL: And these attacks on Saudi Arabia are a response to Saudi Arabia's involvement in Yemen. They are also attacks that...PAYNE: But you're not justifying the attacks, though, are you, sir?PAUL: No, not at all.But I would say that this is a war going on in Yemen. It's a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. It is not necessarily the U.S. involved in the Yemen war. In fact, our involvement should be trying to get both sides to the table.And I'm the first to admit that Iran is making this very, very difficult. I have been a proponent of diplomacy, but Iran escalating this in this fashion, even if it's only Iranian weapons used by somebody else, Iran is still allowing these weapons to get into the hands of people who are now attacking Saudi Arabia outright.Yes, it's become very, very difficult to find a peaceful solution. But it doesn't always mean that it's the U.S. that has to get involved, that the U.S. has to be bombing other countries.PAYNE: Right.PAUL: This is a fight right now. Iran, if they did, has attacked Saudi Arabia. No one has attacked the United States.PAYNE: And to that point, should Saudi Arabia be at the forefront of this? Many Americans are sitting back and wondering, you know, a lot of our allies, particularly Saudi Arabia, sort of kind of kick back and wait.I saw where you were pretty enthusiastic about an article that talked about $3.6 trillion that we have sunk into the Middle East; 2,300 Americans have died in Afghanistan, 4,488 in Iraq -- in Iraq.And you see -- many people seem to share that with you, and that, maybe, if there's going to be a military confrontation, Saudi Arabia should lead that.PAUL: Well, yes, I think this is a Saudi Arabia vs. Iran battle right now. It's a proxy war in Yemen. And now this is -- if Iran did launch this, it's a launch of Iran against Saudi Arabia.It's a disaster. I mean, it's terrible. It's -- it's making it almost impossible to find a diplomatic solution.PAYNE: Right.PAUL: And, yes, Iran -- Iran is at fault. If these are Iranian weapons, whether they came from Iran or another country, Iran is allowing an escalation of this. And it is a big, big mistake.PAYNE: Right.PAUL: There are billions of dollars worth of weapons there.And, as much as Iran is a menace, Saudi Arabia's got $83 billion worth of weapons they purchase every year. And Saudi Arabia has been bombing civilians in Yemen. So one is linked to the other.But Iran is making it impossible to try to find a peaceful solution to this. I have been one for diplomacy. I have been one for talking to Iran.PAYNE: Right.PAUL: But if it turns out Iran is behind this, it makes it virtually impossible to continue to have diplomacy.So Iran needs to get a message here.PAYNE: Right.PAUL: And it's going to be a real problem. And they're not making things better for themselves.PAYNE: Sir, I have just got 30 seconds, but I do have to ask, are you OK with the term locked and loaded?Representative Ilhan Omar saying that it's actually President Trump who's pushing the idea of war.PAUL: No, actually, I think President Trump's remarks have actually been tempered some in the last couple of days. He specifically said that Saudi Arabia will not direct our foreign policy. And I think that's an important statement for him to make.The other thing is, is that members of Congress like myself, I think, need to come forward and say that this is Congress' role. The Constitution very clearly gives the right to declare war to us.PAYNE: Right.PAUL: And that's because the founders wanted the people to be involved. They wanted the people's representatives. They did not want to make it easy to go to war.PAYNE: Senator Rand Paul, we always appreciate it. Thank you very much.PAUL: Thank you.PAYNE: You're looking live, folks, right now, Capitol Hill, Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee grilling former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski today, pushing for impeachment of the president.My next guest says, cool it.

ANTHONY BRINDISI, D-N.Y.: Thank you, Charles, for having me.PAYNE: You know, as you say this, and as we have sort of heard similar sentiment from older or more established leaders within your party, it feels like the number, the head count for those who want impeachment continues to climb.BRINDISI: Well, it looks like that.But I would say that I have had several conversations with many new members, many freshman Democrats like myself. And the thing that we hear mostly when we're back home in our districts is not overwhelming calls for impeachment.What we're hearing about are prescription drug costs, what are we doing to lower drug costs or build our infrastructure or health care costs or the opioid crisis. And that that's really where the focus, I think, has to be in terms of where we go as a House of Representatives.And it's what I'm working on right now.PAYNE: Congressman, first, it was Russia, and then it was something else, and then it was racism. More recently, it was U.S. Air Force planes landing in Scotland.It seems like a desperate, very desperate attempt, and no longer driven by necessarily congressional responsibility, but personal animus.When you speak to your Democratic colleagues that support this, why don't they get that?BRINDISI: Well, I think everyone goes home, and they have different constituencies in their district. And they're responding to constituencies back home.But I can say that, when I'm home, what I hear are the same things that helped me get elected to Congress, and what I want to focus on as I govern here right now.Just this week, I'm talking to folks back in the district about their prescription drug costs, how much it costs for their insulin or other lifesaving medications.And when they tune on the TV, they're not seeing the work we're doing on them. What they're seeing is us being all consumed with investigations. And, eventually, we have to get some things done for the American people. That's what I'm focused on doing right now.PAYNE: Right.BRINDISI: And I don't care if it's working with Democrats and Republicans. We got to work together.PAYNE: Well, you talk about turning on the TV.When you turn on the TV today, you saw what The Hill just said was \"Lewandowski Hearing Descends Into Chaos.\" And the sound bite we used coming into this segment, I don't see how it helps anyone.BRINDISI: Well, I don't have the pleasure of sitting on the Judiciary Committee. So I haven't seen the hearings yet, but I'm looking forward to watching them tonight and seeing what happened.But I got to say, if I'm sitting home, someone living on a fixed income, someone who's struggling right now to pay for their health insurance costs, it's a big concern.It looks like, again, business as usual here in Washington, Democrats and Republicans fighting, no one getting along, nothing getting done.PAYNE: Right.BRINDISI: And that's what we have to focus on. How do we work together to get things done? That's what the American people want. It's what I hear every time I'm back home in the district.PAYNE: As a freshman lawmaker, are you surprised at how much power your fellow freshman lawmakers seem to be wielding these days, to the point where Nancy Pelosi at times seems to be unable to control the party or at least the messaging?BRINDISI: Well, I would say that everyone has to kind of take a step back and look at why they're here, what we're working on, not always try to be quick to get the latest tweet, retweet or whatever it is that they're trying to get attention for.What I think we should be getting attention for these days are the work we're doing on our committees on a bipartisan basis.For example, I'm on the Veterans Affairs committee.PAYNE: Right.BRINDISI: Last week, we passed 18 bills, bipartisan bills, through the Veterans Affairs Committee. And we don't get attention for that because all the attention is focused on impeachment.Let's see how we can get some things done over the next year going into the election. There's plenty of time for elections, but we got to govern eventually.PAYNE: That's very refreshing. And we appreciate you sharing that with us.Congressman, thank you very much.BRINDISI: Thank you, Charles.PAYNE: Well, the White House instructing two former advisers, Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter,to skip the hearings, citing constitutional immunity.Here's House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on that today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NADLER: According to DOJ opinions, absolute immunity applies to -- quote - - \"the president's immediate advisers who serve as the president's alter ego\" -- close quote.I think we should call this what it is, an absolute cover-up by the White House.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAYNE: So what's the deal here?All rise. Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us.So, Judge, what do you think?ANDREW NAPOLITANO, JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, there is no such thing as constitutional monarchy.The president has immunity in conversations that he has with his most senior aides about military, diplomatic and sensitive national security matters.However, I don't blame the White House and I don't blame the DOJ for trying to frustrate the investigation of the president, because we don't know what that investigation is.Stated differently, if the Congress decides they want to impeach the president, there are no privileges. Until they do that, they're going to get this resistance. There's absolutely no obstacle to Congress getting its hands on whatever it wants from the president once it decides to impeach.But as Congressman Brindisi nicely pointed out, the Democrats are schizophrenic on this. Ms. Pelosi doesn't want it to happen because she knows it's going to be a backlash. She's got 50 or 60 hard-core lefties who hate the president, who have districts where they want them to do it.She's trying to walk that narrow line. It doesn't work.PAYNE: The -- although the term may not be official, have other presidents been able to cite something similar with respect to pushing back on these...(CROSSTALK)NAPOLITANO: Yes, but no president has been in this situation.And in fairness to President Trump, he doesn't know, because the House hasn't told him, if this is an impeachment inquiry or not. Jerry Nadler can say what he wants, but until there is some official vote...PAYNE: It feels like a fishing expedition at the worst.NAPOLITANO: Yes. Yes. And he can and ought to resist a fishing expedition.But an impeachment inquiry, he may not resist, because the Congress' power under the Constitution is absolute. There are no privileges for the president, once they decide to impeach. Anybody they call up there has to answer.PAYNE: Beyond political ramifications, are there legal consequences for Congress saying, the Democrats saying, OK, we're going to go down this path of impeachment, and, again, they come up with a dry hole that yields nothing?NAPOLITANO: Well...PAYNE: Because you wonder about abuse of power.NAPOLITANO: The consequences, Charles, are political, not legal.The consequences would be, theoretically, they would be voted out of office for not doing anything to address the federal issues that they're supposed to address.But there are no -- there are no legal consequences to this at all. It's just -- it's just political. Impeachment is largely political. Impeachment is whatever the Congress says it is.PAYNE: Right.What do you make of the Lewandowski hearings today? Obviously, it was just -- it was explosive. But I don't know what we got out of it, as a public.NAPOLITANO: I don't think we got anything out of it.And if Congressman Nadler asked for my advice -- he's not going to ask for it, but I will tell him anyway. He should hire a professional cross- examiner to examine these witnesses.Lewandowski was correct. The congresswoman's statement was not a question. It was a rant. That is a waste of time. Everybody knows what they think. You want to have a question, get Mike Chertoff or somebody that's a real cross-examiner to ask the questions for you, and then you will start getting answers.PAYNE: Did you see his, I want to say confrontation with Representative Jeffries? Just it was -- it was -- it was really just harsh. It was demeaning. It was really...NAPOLITANO: Yes.PAYNE: It's hard to believe these are elected officials.NAPOLITANO: It's inappropriate in the House of Representatives.PAYNE: Right.NAPOLITANO: It's inappropriate in Congress, inappropriate in the government.I mean, I have seen that in a courtroom. But these are not government officials speaking like that. Government officials should hire a professional cross-examiner, there will be the right questions, and hopefully truthful answers.PAYNE: All right, Judge, always appreciate it.NAPOLITANO: But they won't do it.PAYNE: They won't.NAPOLITANO: Because they each want their 15 seconds on the news.PAYNE: Yes.(LAUGHTER)PAYNE: That will end up on a Web site later on, in a fund-raising event.NAPOLITANO: Absolutely.PAYNE: Judge, thank you very much.NAPOLITANO: You're welcome, Charles.PAYNE: Well, President Trump wants the Fed the play its hand with a big rate cut -- why that might not be in the cards.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: Let's cut to the chase.The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates tomorrow, but probably not the big cut President Trump is looking for. And maybe, maybe that's because we might be seeing progress on the trade front with China.Let's get the read with market watcher Monica Mehta.Monica, it's not just the better tone with China, but the economic data out recently has been phenomenal, today, industrial production 200 percent better than Wall Street expected, homebuilder ]sentiment higher, overall sentiment turning around, retail sales through the roof.We're -- we have got a pretty strong economy.MONICA MEHTA, FINANCE EXPERT: We have a pretty strong economy, but I still think you're getting a cut. I still think you're getting a pretty good cut. And I think you're about to see quantitative easing part four just around the corner.PAYNE: All right, so for the audience, that's essentially Fed money printing, which is a program that was brought into for -- after the Great Recession. Jay Powell has said that, takes credit for that saving our economy.But that was then. Why would we need it now?MEHTA: Well, it's not because there's a meltdown happening like what we saw 10 or 11 years ago.I think that there was some really unusual activity today in the markets. Our monetary system is so complex. And all behind-the-scenes work, we usually never even notice it, it's flawless.But, today, the Fed actually had to intervene and pump in about $65 billion into the system, so banks could clear trades. And, again, it's not because there's a meltdown happening or something very unusual happening. It's really because it indicates that there really isn't enough cash in the system.And that's -- the Fed's been pulling back on quantitative easing for sometime now, pulling money out of the system. I think you're about to see that reverse.PAYNE: President Trump has been very critical of the Fed not just cutting -- hiking rates, rather, but, to your point, pulling billions of dollars out of this system.And it seems to have slowed certainly the recovery down. It seems to have slowed our economy down. And now you have in Europe, where they're doing the exact opposite. We have Mario Draghi saying negative interest rates are great, and that they're going to continue. They're going to pump in billions of dollars into their economy.Could Jay Powell be swayed by that?MEHTA: Yes, I mean, we're still the brightest star on the block.And when you look around the world and you think about where you want to invest, the U.S. is still the safest place. The dollar is very strong. But I think that you are going to see the Fed ease up and put more money back into the system. They may have pulled back too hard.And it really is a testament to how resilient our economy is that, despite raising rates, despite pulling cash out of the system, we have been very strong. And that's something to not gloss over.PAYNE: Right.I have just got 30 seconds, but it sounds like you're saying we're going to get a 50-basis-point cut tomorrow, the big one that President Trump's looking for.MEHTA: Well, at least a quarter, so, at least a quarter.PAYNE: No, no, no.(LAUGHTER)MEHTA: But I -- am I hedging too much?(LAUGHTER)PAYNE: Yes, you are.Monica, I got to tell you, though, that was the best explanation for the emergency action that the Fed had to take today that I heard all day. Thank you so much for your expertise. Always appreciate it.MEHTA: Thank you. Thank you, Charles.PAYNE: So, from New Mexico to California, President Trump turning to the path of most resistance ahead of 2020. Is this all about winning the popular vote?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: The CDC activating its emergency operations center for vaping- related illness, as a seventh person dies from severe lung disease linked to e-cigarettes. The crisis continues to build.We're right back in 60 seconds.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: President Trump fund-raising in California fresh off that rally in New Mexico last night.So why is he setting his sights on deep blue states? Is this all about winning the popular vote in 2020?With me now to discuss, Democratic strategist Laura Fink, American Majority leader, CEO Ned Ryun, and Washington Examiner's Kelly Jane Torrance.Ned, I got to start with you, because I think President Trump has a shot in New Mexico.NED RYUN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MAJORITY: I do.PAYNE: Hillary Clinton did not get 50 percent of the vote. And you can see how it's dropped precipitously since the first time Obama ran there, California, maybe a different question.RYUN: Well, I think there's a couple reasons he's going to do this and go to -- he's in California, Charles.First of all, $15 million is a really good reason to go. And that's what he is hoping to raise out there. But this whole issue of the popular vote, we have to remember Republicans have only won two of the last eight popular votes.And I think this has been a sticking point with Trump. People have tried to delegitimize his 2016 win by saying, well, he didn't win the popular vote, which is, of course, absurd. And I think he wants to make 2020 definitive. He wants to expand on his Electoral College both. That's why it was in New Mexico. And he wants to win the popular vote.But I would also add this, Charles. If he wants to help the GOP win the House back -- the GOP lost four House seats in 2018 in Orange County alone. And if he wants to end the stupidity that we saw today with the Lewandowski hearing, then this collusion and impeachment forever with the Democratic House, he has to help Republicans win the House back in 2020.And for that to happen in California, he has to be present. He has to have a presence for them to be able to win those seats. And I think that's why he's there.PAYNE: Great point.And, of course, recently, he's had the magic touch in very tight races. Many give him the credit for pulling the Republican candidate over the top.Laura, what do you make, though, of President Trump? It's not just New Mexico, but he's been in several states that he did not win last time. And his campaign seems to be very confident that he can win them this time around.LAURA FINK, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I tell you one thing. He better worry about that Electoral College vote, because his popularity is declining.By coming to California, it is correct, he's going to vacuum up $15 million, get that payback for the tax cuts from the wealthy donors that he gave them to. And then he does have to worry about those seats. It was seven seats that Republican loss -- Republicans lost, over half their delegation, clean sweep for Democrats in Orange County.They proceeded through California with Serena Williams-like dominance. And in order to win back the House, which is a long shot at best, they are going to have to be competitive, but be careful, because, in California, it is deeply blue.And every time Trump comes here, it energizes the Democratic base, driving them to turn out, and driving them to resist his presidency, as they have done from the beginning.PAYNE: Kelly Jane?KELLY JANE TORRANCE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Yes.You know, when I went to The L.A. Times to see what they were reporting about Trump's trip to California, the lead stories were all about the protesters who had assembled to meet him, yes.But I think California, I mean, he lost there by over four million votes. That's -- that's more than the three million nearly in total that he lost by to Hillary Clinton in the popular vote.There are other states, though, where he can do it. I mean, New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton only won by less than 3,000 votes. Nevada, Maine, about 20,000 votes. Those, I think, possibly winnable, California not so much.But it is interesting what he's doing in California. He actually sent some officials there ahead of him that talked to state and city officials and homeless reps about the homelessness problem in California.And it was something he was asked about today on Air Force One on his way to California. And he said he's been talking to Ben Carson, HUD secretary, about it, and they plan to do something about it.And what's interesting is, he mentioned that a lot of people, even foreigners, move to San Francisco, move to Los Angeles, because they want a better life there, and then they're finding that these homeless in camps with tents are making it difficult.And I wonder if that was a play for some more donor money right before he goes, but I think Ben Carson is not looking for donor money, and he is going to look into that problem.PAYNE: Yes, listen, I understand we're a very skeptical nation these days. But that homelessness, the crisis in California is an ugly problem that I hope the White House does get more involved in.The other pushback, Ned, is Hollywood, and Hollywood taking this on. It's so interesting, because at least once a year, we get this sort of McCarthy -- McCarthy movie out of Hollywood at least once a year. But now they're sort of taking on the spirit of Senator McCarthy with lists of donors, and they want to go after them and make their names public.What do you make of all of that?RYUN: Well, I have to say that it is amazing how puritanical and McCarthyism is alive and well in the Democratic Party and the left.I will say this. I think the cherry on top of the sundae for Donald Trump is that he gets to go into the backyard of these Hollywood weenies and hold a fund-raiser in their backyard. It's going to blow Debra Messing's his mind and Eric McCormack and Rob Reiner, all of these people.But I think that's also a little bit extra for Trump to be out there, to be able to rub it in their face and say, I'm here, I'm raising money.And I will say this, Charles. Just to clarify, I don't think Trump has to try and compete in all of California to win more votes for the popular vote. He's got to play in Southern California.PAYNE: Sure. You're just -- you're talking Orange County and other places, right.RYUN: And he's got to play in Bakersfield. He's got to play in Bakersfield in California 21.PAYNE: OK.Thirty second, Laura. Kelly Jane brought up some of these other states where Democrats may be vulnerable. Is that legitimate?FINK: Look, I think that there are a lot of states in play. But I ultimately think that Donald Trump won a very narrow election in a handful of states, all of which he's suffering in.So he might have to expand the map, because Pennsylvania is not looking really good right now. Wisconsin isn't looking good right now. Minnesota certainly isn't looking good right now.I mean, so he's going to have to look across the map to try to pull off a victory here because his popularity is declining. There's a shaky economy on the horizon. Americans aren't confident for the first time. For the first time, they are not confident in his ability to handle the economy.And more Americans believe that he's doing a disservice to the economy than believe that he is strengthening it. That's a Quinnipiac poll just out this week. So he really to dig himself out of a hole here.PAYNE: I will say, there's a major difference between polls and the data that I look at every single day.RYUN: That's right.PAYNE: And those numbers are through the roof. People may have anxieties, but, right now, we're doing pretty good.You guys were a fantastic panel. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it.TORRANCE: Thanks, Charles.RYUN: Thanks, Charles.PAYNE: In the meantime, new accusations and new calls for impeachment against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. So where will that fight go?A member of the House Judiciary Committee next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAYNE: 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris joining the calls to investigate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as freshman Democrat Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley actually pushes for his impeachment over new sexual misconduct allegations.But the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, says he's not going anywhere. He's not going to go there, certainly.To a Republican on that committee, Florida Congressman Greg Steube.Congressman, thanks for joining us.I was shocked to read this morning that Jerry Nadler wanted no part of this. I mean, we're talking Jerry impeachment Nadler here. Does that just underscore how farfetched this has become?REP. GREG STEUBE, R-FLA.: Well, I think what was interesting was his quote was -- said, we're too busy trying to impeach the president or dealing with impeachment of the president to be focused on that right now.It's just sad that we have gotten to a place in American politics where people can just make an accusation with no basis, no evidence, no facts to back it up, and then, suddenly, it becomes a narrative to the point where The New York Times is retracting their story, and the justice doesn't even have the opportunity for due process to defend himself.The witness that apparently this happened to is saying that she doesn't remember it happening. The other people that were there says they don't remember it happening. So there's absolutely no evidence to back this up.Yet here we are talking about Justice Kavanaugh again and slandering a good justice's name.PAYNE: Well, yesterday morning, on Axios, there was a description of the Democratic strategy for 2020, which said the idea would be to create villains of President Trump, Mitch McConnell and Brett Kavanaugh.So, I mean, maybe there's not a coincidence that this faulty story was published in the first place.STEUBE: The Democrats want to do anything they can now to undermine the Supreme Court. And so, by doing this, they're creating this narrative to undermine anything and everything that he does.Even Ford's own attorney talked about that this was purely political and he would have an asterisk behind his name for the rest of his career. And that's now what they're trying to do. They're trying to politicize the court by politicizing Trump's nominee.And Americans should just -- should just not stand for it. And I hope that they don't.PAYNE: Are you surprised, though, at how quickly a lot of politicians, mostly Democrats, seized on this New York Times story so swiftly, without any vetting of their own, to even come up with the idea of impeachment?STEUBE: Well, it's just how they have seized on the narrative of collusion with Russia and the Trump campaign.I'm sitting in a Judiciary Committee hearing right now. And that's what we're -- we're talking about. So, for two years, we dealt with this next from the mainstream media and the left that there was this collusion with the Trump campaign. And after 22 months of investigation, oh, find out there is no collusion whatsoever and no evidence of collusion.So any time they have anything that they can make people look negative that are conservatives, they're going to take that opportunity to do it. And I hope that the American people can see through that.PAYNE: And, again, you're referring to Trump aid, former Trump aid, Corey Lewandowski, who did face your committee today.What we saw -- of course, he's the first witness in the Democrats' impeachment probe. To your point, you were there. I'm reading headlines out of this, and it's like the hearing descends into chaos and the personal, vitriolic attacks, very little questioning.The American public, is it OK for us to see -- I mean, I know about the sausage-making, but this seems to be something entirely different.STEUBE: You have chairmen of the Judiciary Committee not following their own rules. You have them making their own rules and not following it.You have the -- such a lack of decorum, where members of Congress are calling the witness a chicken, despite the fact that he showed up here voluntarily. And then after he agreed to show up here voluntarily, he was subpoenaed by the chair.So it's just -- I think people are sick and tired of these political games. They're sick and tired of these narratives. They know that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Yet the Democrats have no other thing that they can talk about, because they don't want to talk about their policy narratives.They don't want to talk about the Green New Deal and Medicare for all, because they know the American people don't support that.PAYNE: Right.STEUBE: So here we are again talking about impeachment.PAYNE: Congressman, thank you very much. We will let you get back.Appreciate it. Thank you.STEUBE: Thanks for having me.PAYNE: Vaping-related deaths nationwide are going up. Is it time for the government to start cracking down?Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: A California man is the seventh person nationwide to die from a vaping-related illness, as the industry comes under heightened scrutiny.So what are the risk of these products?Family and emergency medical doctor Janette Nesheiwat joins me now.You know, this is all -- everyone's talking about this. And now everyone's moving quickly. These states are moving very quickly to take what some are calling draconian action. Is it warranted at this point?DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FAMILY AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE: We have to do whatever it takes to protect our children, Charles. It's very important.We already have now our seventh person that's died from a vaping-related illness. And I myself, I'm having very, very young patients come in with wheezing and chest pain and shortness of breath, and their lungs have collapsed.I'm having to put them on steroids and give them breathing treatments. And some of them are being hospitalized. So we definitely need to take every possible measure that -- what we can do to help protect these young kids, teenagers.PAYNE: Vaping is not new. Why now? Why is this happening all of a sudden?And, listen, we -- in San Francisco, they're talking about outlawing all e- cigarettes. In Michigan, if you're caught with four different flavors, you're considered a pusher.NESHEIWAT: Yes.PAYNE: I mean, does the pendulum swing too far when we now take away choices for even adults?NESHEIWAT: I think these deaths, unfortunately, are just highlighting the fact that there's an epidemic going on.We now have millions of teens who are vaping, middle schoolers and as young as elementary school. And I think banning these flavors is just one step into the equation to help get kids off of the vape.I think we should also look at minimizing and banning commercials and advertising to the kids. We need transparency of, what are the ingredients in these vaping products?PAYNE: Right.NESHEIWAT: And we need FDA regulation as well, because people are dying.But I think the most important thing, Charles, is education. And that education is what's going to lead to prevention.PAYNE: Well, the American Vaping Association president told Neil yesterday that the industry does not target young people. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GREGORY CONLEY, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN VAPING ASSOCIATION: The industry does not target youth. The industry, many people made....NEIL CAVUTO, ANCHOR: These look like cartridges for hard drives.They have strawberry, lemonade, bubblegum, mango, cotton candy, fruity, mint, and on and on.Now, I understand a good number adults might like that. That might help them get off cigarettes.CONLEY: To say a good number of adults have found them helpful vastly underestimates the number of adult smokers who have switched.We are at about three million-plus adult smokers who have bettered their health by switching to vaping products.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAYNE: So, Dr., this week in the U.K., their top medical person in the government's is encouraging vaping. They're going the exact opposite way of America. They're echoing what the vaping industry is saying.They're saying this is saving the lives of people who are chronically addicted to cigarettes.NESHEIWAT: Listen, Charles, it's important to understand that, if used properly and responsibly and in the correct manner, you can use vaping as a means for smoking cessation.But it is by far not the only way to quit smoking. There's nicotine replacement therapy, there's gum, there's patches, there's nasal sprays, there's medications, there's smoking cessation groups.PAYNE: None of that gives you the big plumes of smoke.I do want to ask you, because we have got a minute left.NESHEIWAT: Sure.PAYNE: Just give again -- outline how we can at least make this safer for the children, for our kids.NESHEIWAT: Well, one of the biggest problems we're seeing is these bootleg street drugs, marijuana products laced with oils.And we don't know exactly what they're putting in their vape products. We, number one, need to get those off the streets. We need to educate the kids, stay away from them. If you're going to vape, don't purchase anything off the streets, don't modify the vaping products that you have. And if you want to quit, talk to your doctor.There's smoking cessation support out there. But it's very important that we first try to educate the kids at a very young age. Parents, teach your kids, just say no, stay off the vape, because it's highly addictive.PAYNE: Right.NESHEIWAT: Nicotine is highly addictive. And half of those kids who are vaping are going to go on to regular cigarette smoking, which leads to heart disease and stroke.PAYNE: I have spoken to people in the vaping industry who actually agree with you that there should be more regulations and more education.It's always great to have you. Thank you very much.NESHEIWAT: Thank you, Charles.PAYNE: Well, the very dangerous lesson we should learn here about those drone attacks on Saudi oil plants over there.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: Those drone attacks on oil plants in Saudi Arabia raising new concerns about potential threats of drone attacks here in the United States.So, is this a real threat?Here to discuss, security analyst Aaron Cohen.Everyone, Aaron, first thing went through the minds, first of all, are they really so sophisticated to take out -- to create the carnage that they did in Saudi Arabia? And, if so, how vulnerable are we?AARON COHEN, SECURITY ANALYST: Well, the drones are very sophisticated, Charles.We're not talking about Toys 'R' Us remote control helicopters anymore. This technology has been around since I'm going to say about 2000-2001. It was -- started to be developed by the United States and Israel in the late '90s.And although the U.S. and Israel were the first countries to essentially deploy them legally in the global war on terror, Iran, China, Russia have gotten into the game aggressively.And the reason why is, because, like we have seen with how the Americans and how we use them in Israel against terror targets for strategic strikes, they're very cheap. The cost of innocent life is much lower than it would be, say, flying an F-16 over a target.The training is much more significantly reduced, and that it not only saves lives and reduces risks to the soldiers who are operating them, but you can essentially suicide target these drones, the way they were used in conjunction, Charles, with cruise missiles.And so there were about 500 attacks that were launched simultaneously, and they're very devastating.PAYNE: But, Aaron, how would it -- how would it work here in this country, if indeed, it wasn't one of these drones I could pick up at the local mall, and how would it actually be deployed?And what are the defenses against it? Because many security experts are saying or suggesting that there's no defense against this.COHEN: Well, that's a great question, Charles.So the fact is, is that the technology is getting more sophisticated on the civilian scale. And you can, essentially, for less than 1,000 bucks, walk in and buy one of these drones. The paparazzi in Hollywood use them to film celebs, to capture photos of celebrities now.And so they're very accessible. And the fact is, is that explosives with very little amount of training can be attached to these drones. And they can be used to target civilians. They can be used to target our oil fields here. They can be used to target nuclear facilities.And the truth is, is that you actually need Russian and U.S.-grade anti- missile defense systems to have the radar capability to be able to essentially catch these drones before they enter a certain proximity to your airspace, similar to LAX or Boston Airport.You need sophisticated radar technology to be able to spot these things to defend and thwart them. So they're really dangerous. And it's definitely something that I think all of the U.S. government agencies should not only be looking at in terms of technology to beef up all of our national security interests, but to make sure that our law enforcement agencies have this technology as well, because these things can be targeted at a mall.They can be targeted at any crowded area. So they're very dangerous.PAYNE: They are very dangerous. And it just sounds like it's -- it sounds though as if we have to blanket the entire country with some sort of safety mechanisms, which sounds extraordinarily -- like, it's highly unlikely.We have seen airports that have closed down because of all of this. So what's the next step here in America, so that people feel at least safe? Do we look at vital resources, airports, oil fields, and things like that and leave it to the government?COHEN: Well, those are all great questions.What I would do if I was advising President Trump as his national security consultant is, I would make sure, A, that legislation is in place to be able to enforce these laws pertaining specifically to these civilian manned drones that are caught -- that can be targeted against civilians.PAYNE: Right.COHEN: And then, number two, I would make sure that there is at least a minimal amount of radar equipment that's given out to our security services, whether it's law enforcement, county, state, included in the emergency packages where the warehouses are.We can use them.PAYNE: We have got to leave it there, though. We have got to leave it there. Great information, frightening, but great.Thank you very much.And, well, that will do it here, but, tomorrow, remember, decision day at the Federal Reserve -- 2:00 p.m. Eastern, I'm all over it with instant analysis on \"Making Money\" on the FOX Business Network.\"The Five\" starts now.", "tags": ["yourworldcavuto", "transcript"], "published_time": "2019-09-18 11:29:35", "modified_time": "2019-09-18 11:29:38"}
