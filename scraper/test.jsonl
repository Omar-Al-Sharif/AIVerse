Spanish football must a driving force for respect, inspiration, inclusion, and diversity and must set an example with its behavior both on and off the field.\" The statement also congratulates the triumphant Spanish women's team at the Women's World Cup last month, describing the squad's win as \"a historic milestone filled with significance that will mark a before and after in Spanish female soccer, inspiring countless women with an invaluable triumph.\" Rubiales' unwanted kiss on Spanish forward Jennifer Hermoso after the team's victory in the Women's World Cup sparked condemnation in Spain. Rubiales has been provisionally suspended by FIFA for 90 days while a disciplinary investigation takes place. In their statement, the Spanish men's captains go on to express their \"regret\" that the ongoing saga has \"tarnished\" the success of La Roja. The statement closes by saying the men's team will now \"focus on sporting matters\" ahead of the upcoming games against Georgia and Cyprus. The Spanish Court of Arbitration in Sport (TAD) agreed to open a case against Rubiales but rejected the government's argument that his offenses were \"very serious,\" preventing his immediate suspension and forcing ministers to ask the tribunal to do it instead. Hundreds have turned out in protest against Rubiales. Spain's women's team has refused to play until Rubiales is removed. Hermoso herself reiterated that she did not appreciate or consent to the kiss.

Now, the men of Ukraine's 47th Mechanized Brigade have renamed it \"the road to hell\" and the picture they paint is apocalyptic: the sky \",\" constant artillery and aerial bombardments and the once-fertile fields crammed with Russian mines, trenches and dugouts that make any southward progress virtually impossible. Yet southward progress is precisely what the Ukrainian soldiers with the call signs Karatsupa, Pan and Taba seek, driving their American-made Bradley Fighting Vehicles down a road that is also, they believe, the road to Ukrainian victory. Every day, under relentless fire, they drive fresh troops in and spent ones out, with just 30 seconds to make the swap on the battlefield. \"I've been serving since 2014 and I've never encountered such minefields anywhere. Just hectares of them, to the left and to the right,\" said Karatsupa. \"A lot of trenches, dugouts. And all this for dozens of kilometers. They even throw mines at the territory we are taking. Without the mines, we would already be in Tokmak.\" Much has been made of the strategic importance of Robotyne for Ukraine's three-month-long southern counteroffensive. But its capture has enraged the Russians further, say the men of the 47th Brigade. The remains of what was a village of 500 before the war continue to be pounded day and night. Not just by artillery and aerial bombardments, but most fiercely by drones. \"The sky is black with them,\" said Pan. Surveillance drones, attack drones, some Ukrainian, some Russian - it is, he said, impossible to tell. The worst are kamikaze drones that will follow you and obliterate you, he explained. And, after a month of fighting, there was so little left of the village they took in late August that they couldn't believe what they found: civilians still cowering in their basements. After the infantry told them to gather their things, they were rushed into the Bradleys under constant fire. One woman brought her cat, another civilian asked if he could bring the car he'd spent his life savings on before the war by driving it out sandwiched between two Bradleys. \"Things in the occupied territories are different,\" said Pan, explaining that the vehicle was an old $300 Zhiguli but that \"belongings there take on a different meaning.\" After some negotiation, the car was left behind as the evacuation got underway. \"The Russians immediately started shelling us,\" said Karatsupa. \"It doesn't matter to them who is there - military or civilians. They don't care. As we closed the Bradley's ramp, the artillery barrage began immediately. Luckily the vehicle is good and we drove away. We reached the next turn and the Russians opened fire on us again, even though they knew we were carrying civilians.\" CNN is unable to independently confirm that the Russians were aware the vehicle was transporting civilians. In a forest nearby, the Ukrainian troops unloaded the mostly elderly men and women, starved and filthy after a month spent underground, during the worst of the fighting. \"They told us that the Russians had treated them like slaves,\" said Karatsupa. \"They had to steal from the Russians in order to have something to eat.\" But even before the counteroffensive and the month-long battle for the village itself, their lives, he said, had been made unbearable by a Russian occupation none of them had the means to flee. Like so many villages and towns in the Zaporizhzhia region, Robotyne was cursed from the very start of the full-scale war by its geography, finding itself just south of where the Russian invasion stalled in March 2022 and therefore beyond the reach of any help. \"They forced them to do various jobs, did not let them out of their homes,\" Karatsupa said of the civilians. \"They were treated like servants. And these people had nowhere to go. They did not want to go to Russia, but they could not get to Ukraine. They stayed, endured, worried. They were very happy when we arrived, when they realized that the Armed Forces of Ukraine had come to the village.\" But without the , say the men, no one would have survived. They proudly showed CNN some of the direct artillery hits the US-made armored vehicles had taken, singing their praises repeatedly Their only disadvantage, says Karatsupa, is their distinctive whistling sound, which can be heard from miles away. This does have a plus side in instilling fear into the Russians, he added, and in reassuring frontline Ukrainian infantry, who know fire cover is on its way. But no vehicle, however remarkable, is ever entirely impregnable. And Karatsupa, Pan and Taba now carry with them not only pride at what they've achieved but also grief at what they've lost. Some of the men with whom they captured Robotyne last week have since been killed in a direct hit on their Bradley. A reminder that however important the gain of Robotyne is to the counteroffensive, there is far more loss ahead, further down the road to hell.", "tags": ["brand safety-nsf sensitive", "brand safety-nsf war and military", "brand safety-nsf weapons", "continents and regions", "domestic alerts", "domestic-international news", "eastern europe", "europe", "military", "military weapons", "russia", "russia-ukraine conflict", "ukraine", "unrest", "conflicts and war", "weapons and arms"], "published_time": "2023-09-05 10:11:52", "modified_time": "2023-09-05 10:11:52"}

The pilot, named by Ukrainian officials as Maxim Kuzminov, explained in the interview how he planned his defection and why he felt compelled to do so. \"I contacted representatives of Ukrainian intelligence, explained my situation, to which they offered this option: 'Come on, we guarantee your safety, guarantee new documents, guarantee monetary compensation, a reward,'\" the pilot said, in a recording released Monday. The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence, Kyrolo Budanov, revealed in August how Ukrainian officials had been able to help the pilot to defect. \"We were able to create the conditions to get his whole family out undetected, and eventually create the conditions so that he could take over this aircraft with a crew that did not know what was happening,\" Budanov told Radio Liberty at the time. \"Two more people were with him - a full crew of three persons in total. When they realized where they had landed, they tried to escape. Unfortunately, they were eliminated. We would prefer (to take) them alive, but it is what it is.\" In the interview released Monday, the pilot detailed how the event unfolded. During one flight, the pilot said \"I realized that I was near the border. I relayed my location. I said: 'Let's give it a try, I'm not that far away.' And, having made a final decision, I flew at an extremely low altitude in radio silence mode. No one understood what was going on with me at all.\" The pilot said he was able to land in Ukraine, where he was met by Ukrainian officials. The circumstances of the interview are unclear, but the pilot appeared to be speaking freely. At the time, one unofficial Russian Telegram channel, surprised by the flight data, reported that an Mi-8 helicopter had flown into Ukraine and landed in the central region of Poltava by mistake. \"No one has done this before, but I hope we can now scale it up,\" said Budanov. In the newly published interview, the pilot also pushed back against Russian misinformation about the invasion of Ukraine. \"The truth is, there are no Nazis or fascists here. It's a real disgrace what is happening here. Murder, tears, blood. People are simply killing each other. That's all I can make of this and I don't want to be a part of it,\" he said. \"What is going on now is simply the genocide of the Ukrainian people. Both Ukrainian and Russian. The motivation for my action was to not contribute to these crimes. Ukraine will unequivocally win this war simply because the people are very united. Before they were not like this, but now they are very unified. The whole world is helping them, because first and foremost, human life should be valued.\" The pilot also urged other Russians in the military to defect to Ukraine. \"You'll be provided for, for the rest of your lives. You will be offered a job everywhere, no matter what you do. You'll simply discover a world of colors.\" CNN has been unable to verify the pilot's identity.

In her village of Haterk, tucked in a valley between the , food supplies ran out quickly and the shops started to close, Kirakosyani told CNN. The only food available was what she could pick from her garden, mainly tomatoes and beans. Throughout her pregnancy, Kirakosyani could not attend her hospital consultations as public transport was cancelled due to fuel shortages - instead she walked for miles to the local medical clinic, which did not have the capacity to detect early problems with her pregnancy, she said, speaking to CNN by telephone. Kirakosyani is one of the 120,000 inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh - known as the Republic of Artsakh by locals - a disputed territory home to a majority ethnic Armenian population that is internationally recognized as being a part of Azerbaijan. The region has been blockaded since December 2022, when the only road connecting the landlocked region to the outside world, the Lachin corridor, was blocked by \"eco-activists\" backed by the Azerbaijani government, which has since installed a military checkpoint along the corridor. This prompted the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) to warn of the risk of genocide against the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh. Six months into her pregnancy, Kirakosyani felt a pain in her abdomen and was taken to the hospital. On the way, the ambulance had to stop and collect six other patients, as the driver had to ration its fuel. When Kirakosyani finally arrived in hospital, she was told her pregnancy was in jeopardy and she would have to give birth three months early. Her husband was away working with the military, and he could not get fuel to make the 100-mile car ride to support her in the hospital. She was alone when the doctors told her she had had a stillbirth brought on by malnutrition and stress, she said. \"If not for the blockade, I would be playing with my child today,\" Kirakosyani told CNN. According to statistics provided exclusively to CNN by the Ombudsman of the Artsakh Republic - a public official who monitors protection of human rights by state and local self-government bodies - the number of recorded miscarriages has increased fourfold from this time last year. And, as shortages of food, fuel and medicines caused by the months-long blockade take an increasing toll on the region's population, officials there have reported the from malnutrition on August 15, according to Gegham Stepanyan, the ombudsman of Artsakh, who CNN reached by phone. International media have been refused entry into the territory since the blockade was imposed. The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, a bipartisan US congressional body, has on the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. The Lachin corridor is known locally as \"the road of life,\" as 90% of the food consumed in Nagorno-Karabakh previously came into the region from Armenia via that route, according to figures provided by the elected president of Nagorno-Karabakh. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which was previously the only NGO allowed to bring humanitarian aid across the Lachin corridor, desperately needed food supplies to the region on June 14, according to an from August 18. In August, UN experts urged Azerbaijan to end \"the dire humanitarian crisis\" in the enclave by lifting the blockade, while former International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said there was \"reasonable basis to believe that genocide is being committed against Armenians.\" , a lawyer hired by Azerbaijan called the claim of genocide \"a groundless and very dangerous allegation.\" Artsakh President Arayik Harutyunyan, who was elected in 2020, told CNN by email: \"Azerbaijan has blockaded the Republic of Artsakh with the ultimate goal of committing genocide against our people.\" Asked by CNN for comment, the Armenian government shared remarks made by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in a cabinet meeting, : \"Azerbaijan is subjecting the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to genocide by subjecting them to starvation.\" CNN reached out to the Azerbaijani foreign ministry for comment but has not heard back. As food, medicine, water and fuel are prevented from entering the territory, local supplies are dwindling. According to the administration for the Artsakh Republic, dairy products, cereal, fish, chicken, cooking oil, sugar, salt, fruit and vegetables, as well as fuel and hygiene products, are unavailable inside the territory. Max Mkhitaryan, a shopkeeper, took CNN on a video tour of his shop in the capital, Stepanakert. He told CNN that before the blockade he had received most of his produce from Armenia. The only things now left on the shelves were packets of bread, locally produced honey, and a few bottles of vodka. With most shelves empty, he says he can now only serve one in 10 customers. \"Before I used to serve 250 customers per day - now I can barely serve my family. I only have one week left until the shop closes and I am jobless,\" he told CNN. Outside his shop, queues for bread meander through the unkempt streets. Garbage collections are regularly postponed due to fuel shortages, while in the local pharmacy, supplies are rapidly diminishing. The fuel shortages also mean electricity is rationed, with power cuts for eight hours each day, and drinking water is no longer treated, leading to a spike in related illnesses, according to Stepanyan. According to the enclave's administration, 95% of residents are suffering from malnutrition and hidden hunger, a term referring to a lack of essential vitamins and minerals. As winter beckons and the harvest season approaches without fuel to collect the crops, those trapped in Nagorno-Karabakh fear their cries are being ignored. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been engaged in a tug of war over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh since the collapse of the Soviet Union. This power vacuum was filled by nationalism, and violence against ethnic minorities quickly followed. Both Armenians in Azerbaijan and Azeris in Armenia claim they were ethnically cleansed, leaving sectarian scars on the minds of generations - on either side of their disputed border. In the early 1990s, Armenian forces took control of large swaths of territory in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey, in turn seized control over large parts of those territories during a six-week war in 2020 that claimed thousands of lives. The separatist territory was left with the main city of Stepanakert and a few surrounding towns, as well as a population still reeling from the losses of the bloody 2020 conflict, which was followed by sporadic skirmishes along the border. Amid the latest flare-up of tensions, Baku claims it will fully retake and integrate the territory into Azerbaijan - while ethnic Armenians refuse to be uprooted from a region they claim is their homeland. Ronald Suny, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, told CNN: \"Now that it has won the 2020 war with Armenia, Azerbaijan's ultimate goal is to drive the Armenians of Artsakh out of Azerbaijan. \"Rather than use direct violence, which would incite opposition from abroad... Baku is determined to make the Armenians' lives impossible, starve them out, and pressure them to leave,\" he said. To make matters more complicated, Azerbaijan - a one-party state headed by President Ilham Aliyev for the past two decades - has offered to supply the breakaway region via a crossing at the nearby Azerbaijani city of Aghdam. \"Given Azerbaijan's genocidal intentions and their systematic state policy of long-standing anti-Armenian hatred, our people hold legitimate concerns about the safety of any products originating from Azerbaijan,\" Harutyunyan, the elected Nagorno-Karabakh leader, told CNN \"Instead of feigning attempts to deliver humanitarian assistance, Azerbaijan must unblock the Lachin corridor,\" he said. As the blockade carries on with no end in sight, Peter Stano, an EU foreign affairs spokesperson, told CNN of his \"deep concern over the serious humanitarian situation\" and called for the full resumption of traffic through the Lachin corridor, including medical evacuations and humanitarian supplies. A United States State Department spokesperson told CNN by email: \"We urge the government of Azerbaijan to restore free transit of commercial, humanitarian, and private vehicles through the Lachin corridor expeditiously.\" But Harutyunyan told CNN he was \"disappointed with the reactions of the EU and the US so far\" and argued the \"reasons behind the European and American inaction and failures are purely geopolitical.\" \"These reasons include energy reliance on Azerbaijan,\" he added. According to Reuters, the European Union agreed in July 2022 to double gas imports from Azerbaijan by 2027. Meanwhile Russia, which brokered the ceasefire in 2020, has peacekeepers along the Lachin corridor but has refrained from intervening further. CNN has reached out to the Russian Foreign Ministry but has yet to hear back. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on August 2 that Russia dismissed any claim of inaction against the Russian peacekeepers \"as counterproductive and non-reflective of their real contribution to the effort to stabilize the situation on the ground.\" Artyom Tonoyan, a professor of global studies at Hamline University in the United States, told CNN that the Russians, who usually exert influence over the Caucasus, are \"so engaged with Ukraine they do not have the willpower to mitigate the conflict.\" As co-ordinated international action to end the blockade appears unlikely anytime soon, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh are left focusing on short-term solutions: gathering firewood, collecting water and foraging for food. This time last year, Anahit Gharaghazaryan, a schoolteacher and mother of three, told CNN she was preparing lessons for her pupils as they return from the summer holidays. Next week was meant to be her five-year-old son's first day of school. Instead, she is wondering how he will survive the winter. According to a report given to CNN by Stepanyan, doctors consider it unacceptable for children to continue their studies after suffering malnutrition, while a lack of public transport and an inability to access stationery, books and clothing make it impossible for children to attend school this year. At a UN Security Council meeting in August, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Armenia, Vahe Gevorgyan, warned that Azerbaijan's blockade \"has impacted 2,000 pregnant women, around 30,000 children, 20,000 older persons, and 9,000 persons with disabilities.\" \"If the blockade does not end soon - more people will starve. I cannot sleep thinking about how I will feed my three sons,\" Gharaghazaryan said. \"We are all running out of hope.

Purdy told police he didn't know Smith and couldn't provide a motive for shooting him but did ask if he knew his father, who was assaulted in the area in the past, arrest documents stated. Smith was shot three times: in the stomach, the shoulder, and the head, according to the affidavit. Purdy told police he shot Smith in the head \"because he wanted to make sure he was dead,\" the affidavit said, and would have fired more shots \"if he hadn't run out of ammunition.\" Purdy was on probation for aggravated robbery and has since been and his bond has been set at $500,000, police and Tarrant County Jail records show.

Just hours after was sacked from his role as the team's head coach, the country's soccer federation (RFEF) announced he would be replaced by his deputy, Montse Tome. Tome will be the first woman in charge of the women's national team and her debut match will come on September 22 against Sweden. The moves comes as part of a major shake-up in Spanish soccer ever since Rubiales, the president of the RFEF, forcibly kissed forward Jennifer Hermoso on August 20. Rubiales has apologized for his actions and described the kiss as \"mutual\" - a claim Hermoso denied, saying she was not respected. He has been handed a 90-day suspension by FIFA, soccer's global governing body, while disciplinary proceedings are underway. In a statement announcing Vilda's sacking, RFEF said he was \"key to the notable growth of women's football and leaves Spain as world champions and second in the FIFA rankings.\" The federation described the move as \"one of the first measures of restructuring announced by (interim) President Pedro Rocha.\" Vilda had been the women's national team coach since 2015. \"RFEF appreciates his work at the head of the national team and his responsibilities as the maximum sporting figure of the women's national teams, as well as the successes reaped during his term, crowned with the recent achievement of the World Cup,\" the statement added. It also praised Vilda's \"impeccable personal and sporting conduct\" and as a \"key part of the notable growth of women's football in Spain,\" describing him as \"a promoter of the values of respect and sportsmanship in football.\" Vilda, who previously coached Spain's under-17 and under-19 women's teams, led to a first Women's World Cup title last month with a 1-0 victory against England in the final. However, success on the pitch has belied a tense atmosphere in the squad and the long-standing animosity between some of the country's best players, Vilda's technical staff and RFEF. Following the team's victories against the Netherlands and Sweden in the World Cup quarterfinals and semifinals, videos went viral on social media of what appeared to be cold reactions from some of Spain's substituted players towards Vilda and his staff, as well as during the post-match celebrations. One clip showed Vilda trying to celebrate with a handful of players following the win over the Netherlands, only to appear to be ignored. The players' dissatisfaction dates back beyond September last year, when 15 members of the senior women's squad sent personally signed letters to RFEF via email to announce they would no longer play for the national team unless there were wholesale changes made throughout the coaching staff. The identical letters said that \"the situation\" within the Spanish national team - about which RFEF was \"aware\" - had been affecting the players' \"emotional state\" and health. \"As a result, I do not currently consider myself to be in a condition to be chosen for the national team and I ask not to be called up until the situation is resolved,\" the letter read. Of the 15 players who signed the letters, only three were in Spain's World Cup squad: Mariona Caldentey, Aitana Bonmati and Ona Batlle. CNN previously contacted RFEF and Vilda for comment regarding the letter but did not receive a response. After it was released, Vilda described the situation as \"a world embarrassment\" and said the solution was to build a team \"only with players 100% committed to the project.\" Controversy surrounding Vilda has only intensified following the World Cup final as footage from the match appeared to show him inappropriately touching a female staff member while celebrating Spain's goal against England. Vilda did not respond to questions about the incident when contacted by CNN via RFEF. When Rubiales, speaking at the federation's Extraordinary General Assembly last month, refused to resign from his position, he also offered his backing to Vilda and said he was starting the process of offering the coach a new four-year deal on about $542,000 (EUR500,000) a year. \"On another level, a lot smaller (than my situation), but they wanted to do to you what they're doing to me now,\" Rubiales said at the time. \"A false narrative to try to transform it into the truth. We've suffered a lot, we've gone through a lot, we've swallowed a lot, but we've been together: you and me and your team.\" Vilda, like many in the room, was seen applauding Rubiales throughout the assembly. The following day, however, he issued a statement condemning the actions of the beleaguered soccer chief. \"I am deeply sorry that the victory of Spanish women's football has been harmed by the inappropriate behavior that our until now top leader, Luis Rubiales, has carried out and that he himself has recognized,\" Vilda said in the statement, which was widely shared by Spanish media. Prior to Spain's success at the Women's World Cup, Vilda led the team to the knockout stages of the 2019 tournament and successive quarterfinals at the European championships in 2017 and 2022. As coach of the country's youth women's teams, he twice won the under-17 European championships and also the under-19 European Championships.

Satellite imagery from Maxar of Engels Airbase, deep inside Russia, shows two Tu-95 strategic bombers with car tires on top of the airframes. CNN could not independently verify why the tires were placed on the aircraft, but experts say it could be a crude attempt at not only adding another layer of protection against Ukrainian drones but also reducing the visibility of the aircraft, especially at night. The move may have limited effect, according to Francisco Serra-Martins of drone manufacturer One Way Aerospace whose drones have been used by Ukrainian forces. \"It may reduce the thermal signature for exposed strategic aviation assets placed on airfield aprons, but they will still be observable under infrared cameras,\" he told CNN. \"While it seems pretty goofy, they seem to be trying to do the best they can to up-armor the planes that are otherwise sitting ducks. Whether it works depends on what the warhead is on the missile/drone,\" said Steffan Watkins, an open-source research consultant who tracks aircraft and ships. Watkins added that the tires could be used to stop fragmentation of an explosion above the plane from piercing the aircraft. A NATO military official told CNN the alliance was aware of the tires. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak to the media. \"We believe it's meant to protect against drones,\" the official told CNN. \"We don't know if this will have any effect.\" Ukraine has become increasingly bold in targeting strategic assets inside Russia through aerial attacks in recent weeks, even as it suffers assaults on its own cities, setting up a new phase of the conflict defined by Kyiv's apparent efforts to wear down domestic Russian support for the war. Last week six Russian regions including Moscow came under attack, in the on its territory since it launched its invasion of Ukraine. In the city of Pskov, near the Estonian border, several transport planes were reportedly damaged when drones targeted an airport. Earlier in August, Ukraine said it had carried out that house supersonic bombers deep in Russian territory - in what appeared to be an effort to make a dent in Russia's air power, which has been a major obstacle for Ukraine's counteroffensive.

For the first time since 2005, three Americans progressed to the quarterfinals of the men's draw. It also meant at least one US star was guaranteed to be in the semifinals. Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe and Ben Shelton were the trio still harboring dreams of winning a home grand slam. Not since Andy Roddick in 2003 has an American man won the US Open. Shelton will be the American advancing to the semis, as he Tiafoe 6-2 3-6 7-6(7) 6-2 early Wednesday.

On that occasion, 18 years ago, Agassi made it to the final before being beaten by . Given Djokovic and Spanish superstar are both still in the draw, the likelihood of a home winner this year remains small - albeit not impossible. World No. 9 Fritz said morale in the US group was high and that watching others be successful helped motivate his own performance. \"I've said it for a long time, whenever one of us does something, achieves something, it makes everyone else feel like they can do it, too,\" he said, per the . Fritz, who has cemented himself inside the Top 10 over the last year, certainly had the hardest opponent on Tuesday. In Djokovic, he faced arguably the greatest tennis player of all-time, but the 25-year-old American had said he would not be overwhelmed by the occasion. \"I'm not going to overplay. I'm not going to do anything different because I'm playing Novak,\" he told reporters after reaching the quarterfinal. \"I'm going to play my game, play within myself and trust that if I play well, it's enough.\" Both Taifoe and Shelton faced a very different type of challenge. The pair know each other well. Bidding to make a second consecutive US Open semifinal, world No. 10 Tiafoe was the likely favorite for the clash, having dropped just one set at the tournament before Tuesday night. His 20-year-old opponent, though, certainly had the skills to cause Tiafoe problems. The youngster has a booming serve and an impressive forehand. \"It's a big match. He's Bugs Bunny. He's got crazy energy, endless energy,\" Tiafoe told reporters about facing Shelton. \"He's going to come after me, and I'm going to come after him. It's going to be a great battle, we're going to compete really hard.\" Shelton upset fellow American Tommy Paul to reach his first US Open quarterfinal. The result at the time matched his best run at a grand slam, having reached the same stage at the Australian Open earlier this year. It's further evidence of his impressive rise from outside the Top 100 last year to his current position as world No. 47. \"I really learned how to be mentally tough,\" Shelton said before the Tiafoe match, explaining how he's improved since the Australian Open. \"When I was playing in Australia after a long week, I was looking at my box, saying, 'My legs are dead.

It's 2019, and Emeralds can't speak, not because guards are waiting outside the meeting room door, but because he's been mute since he woke after trying to take his own life in detention on Christmas Island soon after arriving in waters on a refugee boat in 2013. Emeralds was in court to seek a protection order against an immigration detention center supervisor who he accused of bullying. It was one of many court hearings initiated by Emeralds as he pushes back on a system that has kept him behind bars for 10 years. On Wednesday the High Court of Australia will deliver a ruling related to one of his more significant cases, which could give new hope to at least 130 detainees facing indefinite detention and others held for long periods in immigration limbo. The High Court will decide if the Federal Court has the power to order the government to hold detainees in places other than formal detention centers, including the private homes of their supporters. \"It will have vast implications for people who are subject to indefinite immigration detention and who the government has not bothered to remove from Australia or find some other solution within a reasonable period,\" said Emeralds' lawyer Sanmati Verma, from the Human Rights Law Centre. However, Verma said Emeralds doesn't stand to gain from any High Court win because of an extraordinary decision by the previous Home Affairs minister to change his status to circumvent a court order - a move that can only be altered by another ministerial intervention. Emeralds' situation has become so hopeless that last year he sought a friend's help to apply for voluntary euthanasia, which is legal in Western Australia, where he is being held. \"Ned's case is kind of like an exploration of all of the Kafkaesque aspects of Australia's immigration detention and asylum regimes,\" Verma said. \"There's no earthly reason why Ned should be detained.\" In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Australia's Home Affairs department said it does not comment on individual cases. The man who adopted the name Ned Kelly Emeralds, in homage to the famousAustralianbushranger, fled Iran in July 2013. At the time, the Australian government was fortifying its immigration policy to deal with an influx of asylum seeker boats, but hadn't yet told new arrivals they would never settle in the country. That came days later, when Emeralds, then 27, was already detained in the northern city of Darwin. He was soon flown to the small Australian territory of Christmas Island, where it would be two years before he'd be invited to apply for a visa. In that time, his by a government error, exposing sensitive details about why he'd fled Iran, according to the government's own admission. For him, the stress and the stakes were higher than ever. By the time Emeralds was asked to explain at a formal interview why he was seeking asylum, a suicide attempt had robbed him of his voice. He scrawled answers to questions on paper, saying he was a metallurgical engineer who feared persecution because he had renounced his faith, an illegal act in Iran. In May 2016, the Australian official made a preliminary finding that he was owed protection. But no visa was offered, and it was two years before he was told that a new official had taken up his case, who subsequently refused his claim. Verma believes Emeralds' mutism worked against him. \"How do you assess the credibility of somebody who is psychogenically mute, and who is providing responses to your questions as quickly as they can, but in writing that's being read out to the decision maker? How do you assess credibility in the usual way, based on spontaneity, detail. How do you do that?\" Emeralds challenged the negative ruling multiple times, and in 2021, the Immigration Assessment Authority (IAA) found again that he wasn't owed protection. \"The person refused his protection visa application never met Ned,\" Verma said. \"Certainly, none of the reviewers at the IAA ever bothered to meet Ned. They dealt with him on the papers.\" In the statement, the Home Affairs department spokesperson said a \"non-citizen's status is resolved through either a substantive visa grant or departure from Australia.\" The latter is not an option for Emeralds, because Iran doesn't accept involuntary returnees, and without a visa he remains stuck in the system. Facing a life of indefinite detention, Emeralds' lawyers sought a ruling of - unlawful detention - but that again hit a roadblock in June 2021, when the High Court ruled in another case that Verma said other asylum seekers who had hoped the ruling would see them freed, withdrew their applications for fear the likely outcome was a transfer offshore to Nauru, the , the last of whom was transported off the island in June 2023. But not Emeralds. \"Ned was one of these unique people, where he was sort of like, well, you know, liberty's liberty,\" Verma said. His lawyers pressed forward with a claim that Emeralds should have been sent offshore within days of this arrival in 2013, alleging the government had failed in its duty to remove him. The argument worked. On October 27, 2021, Emeralds came so close to being freed that he was sitting with his bags packed at a bus stop at Perth Immigration Detention Centre, waiting to be picked up. Two weeks before, on October 13, 2021, Justice Darryl Rangiah had ruled that Emeralds should be transferred from the detention center to a private six-bedroom house, while the Australian government started the process of transferring him to Nauru. Annette and Miguel Castillo had hurriedly cleared a room for their guest, whom Annette knew from her visits to the detention center. But the day didn't proceed as planned. \"He was waiting all day sitting there, and we were on the other side, sitting all day and waiting for him,\" Annette Castillo told CNN at the time. He was waiting all day sitting there, and we were on the other side, sitting all day and waiting for him Annette Castillo, Perth resident \"We cleaned the whole room, we put furniture in, so it was a big undertaking. We're very happy to do that, and we can help him, but at least they should have told us he wouldn't come.\" That morning however, Nauru had informed Australia they wouldn't accept him. Karen Andrews, Home Affairs Minister at the time, then personally intervened to change his status so he didn't require offshore processing, which negated the need to house him while those arrangements were made. A notice seen by CNN said the decision was made \"in the public interest.\" CNN asked the Nauru government why he was rejected but didn't receive a response.A spokesperson for Andrews declined to comment, saying the \"management of individuals in immigration detention is a matter for the current government.\" Weeks later, in a move that seemed to rub salt into wounds, the government appealed the original ruling - and won. The Full Court of the that the Federal Court doesn't have the power to order the government to hold detainees at a specific location. The High Court's final ruling on the matter this week will decide if it does. Annette Castillo met Emeralds through a friend when she regularly visited people in detention centers. She doesn't go now because of the stress of their stories. \"I have a heart condition and each time I come home, I have to go to hospital,\" she said. \"I get so upset.\" Others supporters have stepped in to text and visit Emeralds in detention, including musician and activist Dawn Barrington, who was the friend who agreed to help him pursue voluntary euthanasia. \"I didn't try and talk him out of it,\" she said. \"I basically said there's a strict criteria, so it's highly unlikely that they will let it go through ... I think that going through that process was just another example of how hopeless the situation was because it's like there's no way out for him.\" Barrington told Fran Hamilton about Emeralds' situation and she said she was so \"horrified\" that most Fridays she now gathers with protesters outside St. Paul's Anglican Church in Perth, holding a sign saying \"Free Ned.\" \"Everyone I speak to, once they know, they're really shocked that the Australian government is doing this,\" Hamilton said. I wonder if part of his way of coping is to just let go of hope, which is horrific Rev. Gemma Baseley, St. Paul's Anglican Church Rev. Gemma Baseley, the church's rector, said she has sat with Emeralds during his various hunger strikes, when he's been \"very, very low,\" and now regularly visits him at Yongah Hill Immigration Detention Center, over an hour's drive from Perth. \"You'd think it would be a really depressing visit, and it never is, like he's so funny,\" she said. \"I wonder if part of his way of coping is to just let go of hope, which is horrific. That surely is the cruelest thing we can do to someone - to make them believe there is no hope.\" Emeralds told CNN by text that he prefers not to involve his supporters in all his \"difficulties, at least not in details, they have a life to live outside.\" \"For me (their support) is priceless, helping without expecting to have it back,\" he added. Emeralds may have supporters during his long period of detention, but he has angered some detention center staff by filming them, according to videos posted online to his various social media accounts. He regularly shares videos of protests by other detainees, drawing attention to life on the inside and railing against the system and those who run it. The authorities consider him a troublemaker, according to multiple people who know him. The years of detention have taken their toll on Emeralds' mental health, according to clinical psychologist Guy Coffey, whose assessment was included in the High Court submission. Coffey found \"the largest contribution to his mental state has been his extended detention,\" and he didn't \"anticipate any significant improvement in his mental health while he is detained in his current circumstances.\" Emeralds told CNN he stopped thinking about freedom the day the minister refused to honor a court order and left him waiting for hours at a bus stop before he was told be wouldn't be leaving. Getting used to a cage, which cannot be done ever Ned Kelly Emeralds Asked this week how he was holding up, Emeralds texted: \"Getting used to a cage, which cannot be done ever.\" Verma says the new Labor government should have moved to free him five weeks ago when ASIO - Australia's intelligence agency - confirmed that he doesn't pose a risk to national security. \"Five weeks in the context of somebody's deprivation of liberty for a decade is too long, there should be the highest degree of urgency,\" she said. \"Ned remains one of the longest serving detainees who's still there. You would expect an almost daily watching brief. \"There are two ministers capable of exercising that power. It's five weeks too long.\" The Home Affairs department spokesperson said in the statement that portfolio ministers only intervene in a \"relatively small number of cases where they consider that it is in the public interest.\" \"What is in the public interest is for the Minister to determine,\" the statement added.", "tags": ["australia", "continents and regions", "domestic alerts", "domestic-international news", "iab-law", "iab-politics", "immigration", "immigration", "citizenship and displacement", "international relations and national security", "iran", "law and legal system", "law courts and tribunals", "middle east", "middle east and north africa", "oceania", "political asylum", "political prisoners", "unrest", "conflicts and war"], "published_time": "2023-09-05 04:11:12", "modified_time": "2023-09-06 06:58:32"}

This was Marquez at his imperious best, as well as a fine advertisement for a sport that thrives on white-knuckle tension; in a scintillating contest, MotoGP's youngest ever champion roared back to form. His victory means only a disaster for the 21-year-old Catalan can prevent him lifting his second title well before the end of the season. Repsol Honda's record-breaking star began on pole after a typically impressive qualifying session, but quickly found himself playing catch-up to an apparently rejuvenated Jorge Lorenzo. The Movistar Yamaha rider seized his chance in warmer than expected conditions, taking an early lead as a fierce skirmish developed behind him. Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso had gatecrashed the Honda-Yamaha power party on the starting grid, and the Italian took his increasing confidence into battle with Dani Pedrosa and Valentino Rossi. Gradually the front five eased away from the chasing pack, but remained close enough to one another to throw up some heart stopping moments as positions changed lap after lap. The contest reached an electrifying climax in the final moments, with Marquez and Lorenzo diving into an uncompromising dogfight. When Lorenzo seized the initiative with just three laps remaining it looked as though the man from Mallorca might be able to hold on for the win. The two riders knocked fairings as their battle raged, before an audacious and fearless pass from Marquez fired the championship leader back to the front with two laps remaining. The champion held his lead to cross the line to claim his 11th victory from the 12 Grand Prix this season. Marquez was delighted with the win, having missed out to Lorenzo at Silverstone last year. \"I also had a score to settle from last year, when Jorge beat me on the final corner, so I am happy to be back on the top step of the podium! Marc Marquez \"With higher temperatures it seems that both Jorge and Valentino took a step forward,\" he said. \"Above all, Jorge, because he had a great pace and we were fighting right to the end. \"It was important to win, after missing out at Brno. I also had a score to settle from last year, when Jorge beat me on the final corner, so I am happy to be back on the top step of the podium!\" Lorenzo, meanwhile, revealed that he had struggled to maintain the same pace as his rival, and blamed their coming together for the loss of valuable momentum. \"I lost a lot of time when he (Marquez) touched me,\" he said. \"I knew that he was going to try to overtake me in this corner in first gear on the right, but I didn't let him enter. \"On the outside I opened the throttle and he touched me. In the next corner he touched me again as he went into the corner and I lost seven tenths of a second.\" Even so Lorenzo was pleased with his second place. \"I made a really good start and pushed 100%, more than ever, so I am really proud of my riding,\" he said. Rossi - who set a new outright record of 246 starts in the premier class of Grand Prix racing - won the battle behind the leaders to take third from Pedrosa and a disappointed but philosophical Dovizioso. \"The result confirms the improvements we are making,\" the Italian said. \"Finishing the race less than ten seconds behind the leaders was almost a dream before the start, but instead we did it and we were always in with a fighting chance of finishing on the podium.\" The home fans were left frustrated as one of their favorites, Tech3 Yamaha's Bradley Smith, was knocked out of contention by a cracked rear wheel. The Briton's tyre deflated as a result, forcing him into the pits. When he re-joined with a new wheel his chances of a point-scoring finish had gone, but he did manage to ride to within a lap of the leaders, to loud cheers from the stands. \"I tried to stay out and fight through it but it just got too dangerous to ride,\" Smith said. \"When we changed (the wheel), I proved that I have the pace for sixth. It was a good weekend up until the race and the team did a great job, but these things happen sometimes.\" Tech3 could, however, console themselves with an outstanding performance from rookie Pol Espargaro, who forced his way into a highly creditable sixth position. Of the other top British talent, Scott Redding piloted his Open Class Gresini Honda to a solid tenth, but Ducati's Cal Crutchlow could only manage twelfth. The talented Coventry-born rider must surely be counting the days until he leaves for his new team, LCR Honda, at the end of an intensely trying season. The championship now takes a two week break before the San Marino MotoGP, with Marquez a titanic 89 points clear of Pedrosa, and Rossi a further 10 points back in third, with only six races remaining this season.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2014-09-01 11:35:44", "modified_time": "2014-09-01 11:35:44"}

Two Russians and one French national, ages 28 to 63, were on board the boat as it traveled from Vanuatu to the northeastern city of Cairns, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said in a statement. The 9-meter (30-foot) Russian-registered vessel appeared to run into trouble when sharks attacked its inflatable hulls. \"Both hulls of the vessel have been damaged following several shark attacks,\" AMSA said in the statement. After receiving a distress call at 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday, AMSA requested the assistance of Panama-flagged vehicle carrier Dugong Ace, which carried out the rescue operation around 835 kilometers (520 miles) southeast of Cairns in the Coral Sea. AMSA also deployed a rescue aircraft to the scene. AMSA duty manager Joe Zeller said \"a large section\" of the vessel's hull was missing when it was found. \"There's many reasons that vessels are attacked by sharks. However, the motivations of these sharks is unclear,\" he said. Zeller said the trip from Vanuatu to Cairns, a distance of more than 2,200 kilometers (1,400 miles), would normally take about two to three weeks, depending on weather conditions. \"The three males were very happy to be rescued and they are all healthy and well,\" Zeller said.

Sandee LaMotte is the author of the videos. CNN photographers Bryan Kane and Oliver Janney also contributed to this story.Doctors diagnosed Sandy Halperin with early onset Alzheimer's in 2010Around the globe, more than 46 million people live with Alzheimer's and other types of dementia Sandy Halperin closes his eyes. His expression is pensive, his mouth slightly upturned. Memories, like glints of light, dance inside his mind - a kind of neural film strip. It is 1962. He is in a small neighborhood pharmacy in Springfield, Massachusetts. His father, the pharmacist, hands a customer a wooden nickel, good for a free cup of coffee while she waits. He sees his 12-year-old self standing over a towering hot fudge sundae at the soda counter. The smell of warming cashews and peanuts curls out of a corner machine. Then, as the mind is wont to do, Sandy's memory leaps to a different time. He is 8 years old, standing next to his father behind the counter. His fingertips are flecked with white as he fills empty capsules with medication, clasping them together before handing them off to his father. Sandy slowly sighs. His eyes flutter open as the reverie ends. Whatever soundtrack his mind generated to accompany memories of his father's pharmacy dies out, replaced by the din of Florida cicadas. \"Those days with my father influenced my life forever,\" he says, before his voice trails off. \"I remember it. I can shut my eyes and see it, yet I won't remember the movie I saw last night.\" Alexander \"Sandy\" Halperin sits on a bench, surrounded by gnarled oak trees, at the retirement village in Tallahassee where he lives with his wife, Gail. His face is framed by a trimmed, graying beard; the rest of it is smooth - almost too smooth for a man about to turn 66. He has an engaging manner of speaking. He looks you in the eye intently, at times waving his hands to make a point, or lightly touching your arm. His voice rises with the passion of his persuasion. He tells a well-timed joke, and laughs joyfully with you. If you were not paying close attention, you might never know Sandy Halperin has dementia. Doctors diagnosed him with early onset Alzheimer's in 2010, but he traces his first symptoms back to 2008. \"He was always a very inventive and creative person; he always has a lot going on, always able to juggle a million things,\" says Lauren Halperin, 33, his younger daughter. For years, the former dentist and assistant professor at Harvard relied on his wit and intellect, what neurologists call his considerable \"cognitive reserve.\" But lately, that inventiveness is withering. He punctuates most thoughts with an apologetic \"I forgot what I was saying,\" or a more frank, \"I lost it...\" When he tries to follow a conversation's twists and turns - or recall the minutiae that form a productive day - the mantras of \"I forgot..where was I?\" and \"Where did I leave off...?\" and \"Remind me again...\" can seem relentless. Call them conversational hiccups. Except these hiccups aren't abating - they will only get worse. \"I see a lot more frenzy and desperation in his communications with people now,\" says Karen Halperin Cyphers, 35, Sandy's older daughter. She compares it to what her daughter Madeline did as a 3-year-old when she was asked to take something to the trash. \"The whole way to the trash she says 'Bring this to the trash, bring this to the trash, bring this to the trash,'\" Cyphers says. \"I see that happening. I see him thinking, 'I know what I need to say; I know what I need to say; I'm gonna say it ... right now!\" At times, the memory loss is painful, Sandy says. \"All we really are is our thoughts and our brain,\" he says. \"So this is a different kind of pain. It's not a physical pain, the pain is emotional.\" Around the globe, more than 46 million people are living with Alzheimer's and other types of dementia, says the . That number is expected to rise to 131.5 million by 2050. More than 5 million people reside in the United States, but only half are formally diagnosed. Losing the ability to think and recall - what could be defined as the very essence of being human - is almost universally terrifying. So terrifying that many people dwell for years in a state of denial. In fact, according to a survey by the , an Alzheimer's diagnosis stirs more fear than any other major life-threatening disease - even cancer or stroke. Denial, it would seem, shrouds the mind from dementia's more appalling images: patients shuffling aimlessly around a nursing home in wheelchairs, despondent. Or the converse image of the agitated patient thrashing wildly with no concept of where - or even who - they are. Sandy bristles at those images of Alzheimer's. While they may capture what the disease looks like during later stages, he says they ignore what could be many productive years during the early and middle stages. In those years, he says, it is possible to live vitally, despite deficits. He believes he is doing just that. As best as he can, Sandy remains active and social - dining with other residents at his retirement village and taking twilight walks and pre-dawn swims to try and delay, at least for a while, the symptoms of his disease. He also became a fervent activist - giving talks about stigma, lobbying Congress - and has a Linkedin network of Alzheimer's patients, advocates and physicians numbering nearly 10,000. \"My focus is to help break the thinking that the patient that has Alzheimer's is sitting in a nursing home,\" he says, the passion building in his voice. \"I'm alive. I can still be proactive.\" In Sandy's mind, it is 1956. He is 6 years old. Snow blankets the ground outside. He is curled up on the couch, hugging his legs as his infected lungs spasm. He can hear the faint sound of his brothers gleefully screaming during a spirited snow fight with other neighborhood children. The door flings open. His two older brothers drop a bin filled with snow on the kitchen table. Sandy can almost feel the cold grip his fingers now as he relates how - unable to withstand the weather outside - he often made snowballs from inside the house. \"I was coughing away and sick, so to make me feel good my brothers would bring in the snow,\" he says. \"I would make the snowballs and put them in the freezer so that they'd be ready for their war, their snowball fight with their friends.\" Memories, many from long ago, have become a type of cognitive balm, thoughts to which he clings, tightly, since his diagnosis. He finds comfort in old memories because they are still available to him, often triggered by favorite songs and old photographs. More elusive the past few years: The movie he watched last night; the product he drove to get at the grocery store; or worse, where he put the car he needs to get to the store in the first place. \"My biggest problem is my short-term memory,\" he says. \"It's my ability to recall what I said, what I did, what I need to do, and that's steady through a day.\" Sandy realized he had progressed from garden-variety memory loss - losing keys, forgetting a name - to something far worse about eight years ago when he was working at the Florida Department of Health. His job was to review dental cases for attorneys and consider the merits of patient complaints before the department. He would be handed case files, sometimes hundreds of pages long, and would issue a written or verbal report. His recollection of even the tiniest detail contained in any case he was reviewing was impeccable. Then one day it happened: His memory of a case vanished. \"I am looking at (the case file) for an hour and a half,\" he recalls. \"I'm reading it, it's in my brain. Then I would close the file and not remember literally anything about the case.\" As it started to happen more and more frequently, Sandy struggled to cope. When an attorney would come to his office to discuss a case, he would make an excuse to meet a few minutes later. Almost as soon as the attorney left his office, he would desperately try to cram the details into his brain. He would then run to his colleague's office to try and relate the information before it escaped him again. That desperate scramble worked - for a time - until it became exhausting. \"I would be dizzy and could hardly sit there and concentrate,\" he says of those meetings. \"But I was able to get through the conversation, trying to get out of there as soon as I could.\" It is the only time in his life, he says, that he hid his symptoms. When it became too much to bear, Sandy sought help. After a series of misdiagnoses, he was finally told he had early onset Alzheimer's disease. \"It is a horrifying, gripping, devastating disease that plays havoc on the family and on the patient,\" says Gail Halperin, Sandy's wife. But, she adds, what has softened the blow is the way Sandy responded to it. \"He immediately came out and said, 'I don't want to cover this up. I want to share it with people and be proactive,'\" she says. But suggest that such a response is rare: Nearly 13% of Americans reported experiencing worsening confusion or memory loss after age 60, but most - 81% - had not consulted with a health care provider about their cognitive issues. \"For some reason, it's embarrassing to people that they have this (disease), and it doesn't make sense,\" says Lauren Halperin, adding that some ignore their symptoms, waiting until the last possible moment to seek medical help. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but certain medication combinations - and lifestyle interventions - may help with symptoms associated with dementia. \"By the time they go on medication, not to say it's too late, but they've lost some potentially valuable time,\" she says. \"And I think (my dad) feels like, 'enough of that.' \"If this is something you have, don't be ashamed of it. Go do something so that you can have more time.'\" Four years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Sandy says the flickering lights of times past still cast a glow in his mind. Some days, the glow is barely perceptible. Other days, it burns bright. What he is learning, he says, is to let whatever state his memory is in during a particular day - be. He often quotes a book, \"The Precious Present,\" by Dr. Spencer Johnson, a contemplation of what it might mean to live in the moment. One of the book's more poignant passages, says Sandy, describes how he is attempting to live with Alzheimer's: \"It is wise for me to think about the past and to learn from it, but it is not wise for me to be in the past, for that is how I lose myself.\" It is a towering sentiment - one that he tries in earnest to embody. It's made even more meaningful now that Sandy is noticing not just his short-term memory flagging, but also his long-term. The gravity of that loss breeds wonder. Will his granddaughters remember him when they get older? Has he taught them enough about what it means to be a Halperin? Will they absorb enough of the spirit of giving and joy he got from his family while growing up? \"I want them to feel what it's like to have a grandpa,\" he says wistfully. Almost as soon as he says it, Sandy engages in the sort of mental tug-of-war he will likely play for the rest of his life: He stops himself from thinking about what might be, and thinks about now. \"The other day I had a joyful moment with my granddaughter Rebecca,\" he said. \"I was tickling her and she said something to the effect of 'Grandpa, that was a great tickle.' \"That was like, 'Melt my heart, let me do it again.'\" This moment. Right now. Soon, it may be all Sandy Halperin has. And that is OK.", "tags": ["alzheimer's disease", "chronic diseases", "diseases and disorders", "health and medical", "neurological disorders and injuries", "dementia", "geriatric medicine", "medical fields and specialties", "mental illnesses", "aging and health"], "published_time": "2015-10-12 17:08:49", "modified_time": "2016-06-09 15:43:00"}

The final straw for Cardiff fan Ben Dudley was the decision by the Welsh team's Malaysian owners to rebrand the club by insisting they play in red rather than their traditional blue to boost their appeal to Asian audiences. The internet sparked global interest with Dudley's support eventually bought by a Spurs fan for over a thousand dollars. \"The reception from Spurs fans that have been in contact with me has been great and I've had offers of help with tickets and people to attend games with,\" Dudley told CNN. \"I will also be looking to attend some Europa League fixtures, with my only previous experience of European football coming from watching Cardiff City win the Algarve Cup against Celtic in 2008.\" Trips to Tottenham's home ground will involve a 320 mile round-trip for Dudley, but he doesn't seem daunted as at one stage it looked like he might have to travel abroad in his new supporter project. \"As the auction began to get worldwide coverage, I moved from getting bids from places such as Bristol, Huddersfield and Nottingham to getting bids from New York, Seattle, Istanbul and the west coast of Australia! \"I was rather worried at this stage.

If it isn't, then I will either stick with Spurs, as I believe they are a club who can restore a bit of my faith in modern football, or donate the cost of my Cardiff season ticket to charity and watch non-league football instead.\" However, having become so disheartened with Cardiff , the internet auction has gone some way to restoring his faith in football. \"While in an ideal world I would still feel connected to Cardiff enough to support them, Tottenham have gone a long way to show the good side of the game. \"If you don't get goosebumps when Tottenham fans sing \"oh when the Spurs\" then you either support one of their rivals or you probably don't like football very much.\" The winning bid proceeds are to be split between British military charity Help for Heroes and Ty Hafan, a charity that help life-limited children in South Wales.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-01 21:08:12", "modified_time": "2012-08-02 10:22:50"}

Two of the men were arrested Wednesday and the third Thursday, Spanish Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said. The Interior Ministry said the men were \"ready to act in Spain and Europe.\" One of the men is Turkish, and the other two are believed to be of Russian-Chechen origin. Police sources said they had gathered enough explosives to \"blow up a bus.\" The two men arrested Wednesday were on a bus traveling to France when police detained them, and Diaz said they \"resisted fiercely.\" Police sources said they were stopped in Almuradiel, a town about midway between Madrid and the country's southern coast. The third was held in the province of Cadiz on Spain's southern coast. The investigation is in its early stages, but Spanish security services say the men were most likely plotting to attack the joint U.S.-Spanish naval base at Rota or British interests in Gibraltar, according to Fernando Reinares, a senior international terrorism analyst at The Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid who was briefed by Spanish security services on the investigation. They base their belief on a number of factors: The group's capabilities; the proximity of the targets - Rota is in Cadiz and Gibraltar is adjacent to it; and the fact that several of the men had mastered flying motorized paragliders, which leads investigators to believe the group may have been plotting to launch an attack from the air. The Turkish man also worked in Gibraltar, Reinares said. According to Reinares, Spanish security services believe the alleged cell might have also been plotting a terrorist attack in France, leading to the two arrests on the bus to France. Security services don't rule out the possibility they had planned an attack elsewhere in Europe, though no intelligence indicates they were a threat to the London Olympics, Reinares said. Explosives were found in the apartment of one of the suspects in the area of San Roque, just across the border from Gibraltar, and security services believe more explosives were removed from the apartment in the past two days, Reinares said. Spanish police are still searching for explosives in the neighboring town of San Roque, where they suspect the men had stored bombs and documents. Wiretaps indicate that the Turkish citizen's wife had \"removed evidence from the house\" before the arrest. They are also analyzing the computers and files on a laptop that belonged to one of the arrested men. One of the Chechen suspects was a \"true specialist in chemicals,\" security services told Reinares. Authorities did not release the men's names, but a police source gave the Chechen suspects' initials as A.A.A. and M.A., and the Turkish suspect's initials as C.Y. The source said the men were carrying no documentation when they were arrested. Spanish security services suspect the alleged terrorist cell of having ties to the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Reinares told CNN, and they believe one or more of the trio received terrorist training in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The alleged cell was first detected in Spain around a month ago but had been previously tracked by other Western intelligence agencies, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry. Spain's interior minister said the suspects had information about remote-controlled airplanes, and some of them \"have experience producing explosives and car bombs and training in shooting.\" Reinares said the alleged terrorist cell's operation was different from other recent terrorist plots in Spain that were the work of \"self-starting, self-radicaling\" Islamist militants. He said Spanish investigators believe this cell was dispatched from overseas to carry out a terrorist attack. Reinares said this was not the first alleged terrorist cell linked to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba to be arrested in Spain. A group linked to a militant with ties to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba who had trained in Kashmir was arrested in Barcelona in 2004. Indian and Western intelligence officials suspect that Lashkar-e-Tayyiba is responsible for the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks and that it has established closer ties with al Qaeda in recent years. One of its members was David Headley, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent, who was convicted of helping to plan the Mumbai attacks and plotting to attack a Danish newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. According to court documents, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba commissioned Headley to research targeting the newspaper, but the group never went through with the plot.

The White House supports the idea of a rapid response team for NATO, but National Security Spokesman Caitlin Hayden cautioned that the force would be \"defensive\" in posture. The new force is \"not intended as a provocation, or as a threat to Russia, but rather as a demonstration of NATO's continued commitment to our collective defense,\" Hayden said. New bases will be set up and equipment pre-positioned at bases, a NATO diplomatic source said. \"We are also facing crises to the southeast and south,\" said a senior NATO official. The plan \"needs to be able to deal with all crises that we might be facing in the future from wherever they might come.\" Rasmussen said President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine will attend the summit and NATO will \"make clear our support for Ukraine.\" On the ground, Ukrainian forces appear to be outgunned by Russian rebels. \"We have seen as recently as Saturday, that the Ukrainian army is very, very unarmed compared to the rebels,\" said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring the situation in Eastern Ukraine. On Monday, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that the presence of Russian soldiers on Ukraine soil is completely unjustified and unacceptable. \"Russia appears to be trying to force to Ukraine to abandon its democratic choices through the barrel of a gun,\" he said. Cameron said new sanctions measures will be drawn up by the EU within a week. A Russian army tank attacked airfields in eastern Ukraine on Monday, Ukrainian military officials said, amid worsening tensions between Kiev and Moscow. A battle is under way at the airport of the eastern city of Luhansk, Ukrainian counter terrorism officials said. \"There is a very, very bad situation developing in Luansk,\" Bociurkiw said. \"Ukrainian officials are warning of a humanitarian catastrophe due to the lack of water and electricity.\" Shortly before the attack, Russia urged the Ukrainian military to retreat from civilian locations in the east, saying pro-Moscow separatists in the region will not disarm for fear of getting killed. The same day, Ukraine said one of its patrol boats was capsized and two of its crew are missing off the coast of the city of Mariupol. Officials did not say who was behind the attack. Poroshenko has said thousands of Russian troops are in his nation's east, helping the separatists. A U.S. lawmaker is calling for the arming of Ukrainian forces engaged in fighting Russian troops along the nation's eastern border with Russia. \"Washington and Brussels need to ask Kiev authorities to stop shelling the houses, schools, hospitals and so on because you leave militia with no choice but to stand up to protect their people,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. \"Let's not ask militia to lay down their weapons and allow themselves to be killed.\" Lavrov said negotiations, not threats, will help resolve the crisis between the two neighbors. \"Let us sit down and talk instead of threatening with sanctions and stubbornly making absolutely unrealistic demands of the militia laying down arms,\" he said. \"This is what the peace plan of Poroshenko is about.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin sparked controversy when he talked about \"statehood\" for eastern Ukraine. \"Substantive meaningful talks related to the issues of society's political organization and statehood in southeastern Ukraine should start immediately in order to protect people living there,\" Putin said Sunday. The Kremlin later denied that Putin was calling for statehood in the region, saying he was referring to inclusive talks with all sides represented. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych the previous month. Violence broke out in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April when separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev. Since then, the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has killed 2,500 people, according to the United Nations. A U.S. lawmaker called for the arming of Ukrainian forces along the eastern border. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, is in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, on a fact-finding mission into the monthslong conflict there between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian military. \"We should be providing the Ukrainians with the type of defensive weapons that will impose a cost upon (Russian President Vladimir) Putin for further aggression.\" U.S. President Barack Obama has opposed supplying Ukraine with weapons in the past, but Menendez said he believes the Obama administration should re-examine what he calls changed circumstances there. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko warned Saturday that his nation's crisis with Russia has worsened in recent days and is inching closer to a \"full-scale war.\" European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, speaking at a meeting in Brussels, said new sanctions are in the works for Russia.

Hans Kristian Rausing was charged last month after his wife's decomposing body was discovered by police when they searched the couple's central London mansion after stopping him on suspicion of driving under the influence. He also pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court to driving a vehicle while unfit to drive through drugs, a court spokeswoman said. Rausing, 49, was given two suspended sentences, one for each charge. On the charge of preventing his wife's lawful burial, he was handed a 10-month sentence suspended for two years. He was given a two-month sentence suspended for two years for the driving offense. Rausing was also ordered to undergo a drug rehabilitation program and to remain under the supervision of a probation officer for two years. He must provide samples to be tested for drugs when required. \"If ever there was an illustration of the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families, it is to be found in the facts of this case,\" said Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson, according to the Press Association news agency. \"You and your wife had every material advantage imaginable, and for a time a happy family life. Your relapse into the misuse of drugs, together with that of your wife, destroyed all that.\" The news agency said Rausing told police in a statement after his arrest: \"I do not have a very coherent recollection of the events leading up to and since Eva's death. Safe to assure you that I have never wished her or done her any harm.\" Both Eva and Han Kristian Rausing, who had four children together, had battled with addiction for decades. The court was told that Eva Rausing had returned to London on April 29 after having spent time in a clinic in California, PA reported. The court heard that a pacemaker she had been fitted with because of heart problems indicated that the likely time of death was early on May 7, the news agency said.

Venus, the gold medal winner at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, struggled to cope with the intelligent play of Kerber. The 24-year-old is enjoying the best year of her career, seeing her ranking rise to seven, and never looked in trouble against the seven time slam winning American. Serena Williams, Venus' younger sister, didn't encounter the same problems as she swatted aside 2008 silver medal winner Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 6-0. The recent Wimbledon champion looked in imperious form, hitting 32 winners to her opponents three. \"I think I played better today and even in my second round than any match I played at Wimbledon,\" Williams said. \"I was just playing unbelievable. I felt good. I was relaxed. I felt like, you know what, I'm here to have fun, I have nothing to lose. No pressure on myself.\" In the men's tournament, Roger Federer continued his quest to claim the only major title to elude him with a 7-5, 6-3 win over Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin. The Uzbek player threatened Federer at 5-5 in the first set, but the world number one snuffed out the threat relatively easy. From there on, the most successful tennis player of all time looked comfortable. \"I was happy with the way that I was able to turn it around,\" said Federer. \"Denis, I thought, played a very good first set; I didn't play poorly to let him back into the match. In the second set I guess I learned from the first set and was able to bring it home, so I'm very happy.\" Federer will play the John Isner in the quarter finals after the big-serving American beat Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic 7-5, 7-6. Not everything went Federer's way though, as later in the day he and Stanislas Wawrinka relinquished their Olympic doubles title to the Israeli pairing of Andy Ram and Jonathan Erlich. Elsewhere in the doubles, Brazilian team Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares won an epic encounter with Thomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic. The final set finished 24-22 in 191 minutes making it the longest set in an Olympic men's doubles match, and the match the longest three-set Olympic men's doubles match ever. Federer's main rivals for Olympic gold both endured a difficult day at Wimbledon. Novak Djokovic met former world number one Lleyton Hewitt in a gruelling encounter that ended 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 in the Serbian's favor. Djokovic will face the dangerous Jo-Wilfired Tsonga in the next round after the powerful Frenchman beat Feliciano Lopez 7-6, 6-4. Lopez is only in the singles competition after Spanish number one Rafael Nadal had to withdraw from the competition due to injury. Local favorite Andy Murray also has hopes of winning a medal, having lost in the final at the recent Wimbledon Championships. He met the talented Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in front of a raucous home crowd, producing a nervous 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 win. \"I was pretty unsure of myself at the beginning of the match, I didn't feel comfortable on the court,\" Murray told the Wimbledon website. \"Then I managed to settle myself down and move my feet better to get in better position in the second set. I played some good tennis after that.\" Murray plays Spain's Nicolas Almagro in the quarter finals after the Spanish clay court specialist beat Steve Darcis 7-5, 6-3. Former U.S. Open champion Juan-Martin Del Potro progressed to the quarter finals after recovering from an early scare against Giles Simon of France. Simon, renowned for an unrelenting game, looked to be struggling to match Del Potro's power when he lost the first set 6-1, but he recovered to take the second 6-4. The Argentinian Del Potro recovered his composure to seal the final set 6-3. In the final men's match of the day, Japan's Kei Nishikori shocked number four seed David Ferrer of Spain with a 6-0, 3-6, 6-4 defeat. The match began on a packed court 14, but was moved under the Centre Court roof to ensure match was completed on Wednesday. French Open champion Maria Sharapova faced a difficult test in her third round match, dropping the first set to German Sabine Lisicki. The Russian, who has won all four slams in a hugely successful career, eventually pulled off a 6-7(8), 6-4, 6-3 win. Sharapova, who carried the Russian flag at the opening ceremony, will now face former world number one Kim Clijsters in the quarter finals after the Belgian ground out a 6-3, 6-4 win over Serbia's Ana Ivanovic. Clijsters, who is retiring at the end of this season, hit less winners than her Serbian rival, but forced 41 errors from her.. \"The conditions were not easy today but it was a fun court to play on. Most of the TV courts are huge and there's a lot of room around them but here you can really feel the impact of the crowd and it was very enjoyable,\" Clijsters said. \"I feel like I've been playing some really good tennis in the first three matches here, it's just a matter of trying to keep that up and before every match I need to refocus and stay on target. \"There was lots of Belgian support and Serbian too, it was fun.\" Victoria Azarenka also progressed to the quarter finals after she comfortably beat Russian Nadia Petrova 7-6, 6-4. The world number one has enjoyed a comfortable route to the quarters, but now faces Venus Williams' conqueror Angelique Kerber. Caroline Wozniacki completes the women's quarter final lineup.

In this case the mice are represented by the cataphiles - a group of dedicated hedonists who love to party in the abandoned quarries deep beneath the French capital - and the part of the cat is played by the police who patrol the places most people would fear to tread. Paris has two main underground attractions - one being a vast catacomb which holds the remains of more than six million people, the other being a network of tunnels and quarries that stretch nearly 321 kilometres under the city. At the official catacombs visitors who are prepared to walk down the 139 steps and along endless tunnels are met by truly extraordinary sights as well as a fascinating slice of 18th-century life in Paris. In 1786 the cemeteries of Paris were full to bursting, meaning corpses were often buried near those people still living. After the collapse of a communal grave near the center of the city it was decided to transfer all the bones to one vast ossuary. Nowadays the mountains of unwanted bones have been arranged into a macabre set of alleys and pillars - a process that was started two centuries ago. One of the museum's curators Tram Nguyen told us how people usually reacted on their first visit: \"When you come here for the first time you get quite destabilized but then you get used to it. There are so many bones here you don't see them as human remains, you just see them as decorations.\" Our program was looking as all aspects of underground life in Paris and in the process of researching it we also came across another extraordinary group who put the subterranean spaces to new uses. Urban Experiment, UX for short, is a highly secretive organization which has gained a cult following after successfully completing a series of high profile stunts deep under the city. Members of UX very rarely reveal what, how, or why they do what they do but CNN arranged a series of meetings with one of their members who slowly let us into some of the secrets. We first met Lazar Kunstmann - not his real name but the one he insists on using - in an anonymous Parisian bar. With a shaved head and regulation black clothes he is a friendly, if somewhat cagey, individual. We wanted to know who the UX were. His answer was suitably cryptic. \"The UX is a collective of people who pursue the same aim with a range of skills. It is anyone and everyone. There are no characteristics in terms of age, sex, social or cultural background - the only characteristic is to live relatively close to the area where the projects are carried out, in Paris. All the rules of the UX have to do with feasibility - the practical aspect of the execution of the projects.\" The Palais de Chaillot - or more precisely one of quarries that lies beneath it - was the scene of one their most infamous projects. The group - which has existed for 30 years - dug deep under the theatre to create their own fully functioning cinema in one of the hundreds of caves under the city. They even made their own film to mark the event. Over a beer Kunstmann explains what motivates the UX. \"We are a group who use public spaces, not necessarily the public spaces underground, not necessarily abandoned. It is simple - the only characteristic of the spaces we use is that they are public, and have been left, that's to say \"loosely\" abandoned. The vocation of these spaces is to accommodate projects.\" Secrecy is, of course, essential for Kunstmann and other members of the UX. \"The secrecy is just linked to the feasibility. When we were young we profited from the craze of underground parties in the 1990s in the ancient quarries of the Latin Quarter in order to discover, that in fact there was all this public space, which was totally abandoned, which we could use for anything. Much later, at the same time as wanting to learn more about all this public space, to have a geographic and practical knowledge - that is by getting hold of maps and keys to use the tunnels - we realized this really was the ideal location for numerous projects.\" Before we leave him Kunstmann tells us that the UX have several more projects in mind but, unsurprisingly perhaps, he declines to elaborate saying future plans have to be kept under wraps.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-02 14:47:38", "modified_time": "2012-08-02 14:47:38"}

The musicians said the charge was \"preposterous,\" arguing that artists \"make legitimate political protest and fight for freedom of speech.\" The Pussy Riot members went on trial Monday, charged with hooliganism after performing a song criticizing President Vladimir Putin in one of Moscow's grandest cathedrals, Russia's state news agency reported. \"Mother Mary please drive Putin away,\" the band screamed, their faces covered in neon masks, inside Christ Savior Cathedral in February. Three were arrested soon after. The charge carries a potential seven-year sentence. Putin is visiting London on Thursday, Pussy Riot's celebrity backers noted as they urged him to \"ensure these three women receive a fair trial.\" \"We are especially concerned about recent reports that food is being withheld from them and that they have appeared in court in a cage,\" their supporters said in a letter to the Times of London.

The women apologized to Orthodox Christian believers if they felt they had been insulted, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported. The trial is taking place at the Khamovnichesky Court, the agency said. Amnesty International said Monday the trial \"never should have taken place.\" John Dalhuisen of Amnesty said the singers had been making \"a legitimate protest - this is not a criminal offense.

While many may have found their act offensive, the sentence of up to seven years in prison they may expect on the charges of hooliganism is wildly out of all proportion,\" he said. Pussy Riot specializes in sudden, often illegal public performances, including one in Moscow's Red Square. The punk prayer was inspired by the women's anger about the relationship between the Russian government and the Orthodox Church, according to their manager, Tolokonnikova's husband. The Orthodox leader Patriarch Kyril has been widely reported as saying Putin's years in power have been a miracle from God.

Graf won singles gold for Germany when tennis was an exhibition event in Los Angeles in 1984 then followed it up with \"official\" gold at Seoul four years years later. Agassi topped the podium for the United States at the Atlanta Games in 1996 and in an exclusive interview for CNN's Open Court leaves no doubt where it stands in his list of achievements. \"Being on that podium was a boyhood dream,\" he said. \"The medal around the neck, the national anthem, tears in my eyes. It's an out of body experience.\" Graf's 1988 triumph was even more significant because it came in the same year she won all four grand slam tournaments. Sports Illustrated first coined the phrase \"Golden Slam\" and it stuck. Graf can also wax lyrical about the uniqueness of the Olympic experience. \"To me this was bigger than a grand slam, it was more special,\" the 43-year-old said. \"It's a different feeling, it's very unique and definitely more special.\" Given she was only 19 at the time, Graf's achievements are all the more remarkable. When she arrived in South Korea she was feeling the effects of an arduous season, not to mention a grueling three-set victory over Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina in the U.S. Open final. \"I was a bit tired emotionally, probably physically as well,\" Graf said. \"I just remember arriving at the airport and all the attention that I was getting, I just think I wasn't quite prepared for it at that point.\" But Graf was able to concentrate on the task in hand and it was Sabatini who was again her victim in the singles final, this time in straight sets. The German also won a bronze in the women's doubles and completed a full set of Olympic medals after losing the gold medal match against Jennifer Capriati of the United States on the clay of Barcelona in the 1992 Olympics. Agassi was only 18 at the time of the Seoul Games and he also missed Barcelona. But inspired by his father Mike, who had boxed for Iran at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics - losing in the early rounds both times - Agassi was determined to take his chance on home soil. \"For me to be playing for my country and on top of it to be playing to achieve what my father had hoped for but had not accomplished in his Olympic experience, I just felt like I was playing for something larger than just me,\" said the American, now 42. I remember being on that podium and I remember that feeling of seeing it so many times over the years, what someone might be feeling when that gold medal is put round their neck Andre Agassi Agassi had endured a generally below-par year by his high standards and it was to prove a tough battle for gold, but as the memories flooded back he reeled off in quick succession how he did it. \"Jonas Bjorkman, 7-6 7-6. Karol Kucera, 6-3 6-4. Gaudenzi (Andrea), I was down a set and a break and beat him 6-3 in the third. Quarterfinals, Wayne Ferreira. He served for the match at 5-4 in the third and I ended up beating him 7-5 in the third. Leander Paes, who I beat in two rough sets, 7-6 6-4. And then Sergi Bruguera.\" Playing in 102 degrees Fahrenheit with high humidity at Stone Mountain, Agassi made light of the conditions to dispatch the Spaniard - a two-time French Open champion - in straight sets. He openly shed tears of joy during the medal ceremony that followed. \"I remember being on that podium and I remember that feeling of seeing it so many times over the years, what someone might be feeling when that gold medal is put round their neck,\" Agassi said. \"Tears came to my eyes and my father was in the crowd so I was enjoying it on so many levels.\" While her future husband was winning gold, Graf had the disappointment of sitting out the 1996 Olympics with a knee injury she aggravated while winning her seventh Wimbledon title earlier in the summer. While other top players had often been lukewarm about having tennis in the Olympics, Graf was almost evangelical in her support, feeding off her incredible experiences in Los Angeles, where as a 15-year-old she first made her golden mark in that exhibition event. Four years later Graf enthusiastically embraced the true spirit of the Games. \"I stayed in the village for quite a few days until it got too loud and noisy and then I had to move back to the hotel,\" she said. \"I was out at the boxing, I went to see some of the track and field, some of the swimming competitions, so I was really trying to take it all in, but also trying to play. \"To get through the first few rounds and then playing for the gold medal was extraordinary.\" By the time the 2000 Olympics in Sydney came around, Graf had retired from tennis and a year later she married Agassi. They now have two children, Jaden Gil and Jaz Elle. Agassi continued playing until 2006, winning his final two grand slam titles at the Australian Open in 2001 and 2003. It was his French Open triumph in 1999 that enabled Agassi to complete his own \"Golden Grand Slam\" - one of only two men, Rafael Nadal is the other - to win all the four majors and Olympic gold. As proud parents - on a nominated \"professions day\" once a year - Agassi and Graf visit the Las Vegas school where they send their children to talk about their careers. It's our Masters, it's our Augusta, it's our pillar, the one if you could win one, most athletes, most tennis players would tell you, separate from the Olympics, that Wimbledon is the one they want to win Andre Agassi \"We bring some trophies and all the children just want to take that gold medal, they want to hold it, they want to touch it. 'Is it real gold?' they ask,\" Agassi said. So who will win that \"real gold\" when Olympic tennis comes to Wimbledon, just 20 days after the finish of the All England Championships, won by Federer? \"I look at the favorites being Djokovic and Federer,\" Agassi predicted. As he speaks it is clear that he is envious of the current generation of greats getting the chance to have a double dose of glory at Wimbledon. \"It's our Masters, it's our Augusta, it's our pillar, the one if you could win one, most athletes, most tennis players would tell you, separate from the Olympics, that Wimbledon is the one they want to win,\" he said. \"So you combine that with the Olympics, that's got to be sensory overload. I don't know even how to put that into perspective of what that's going to feel like.\" Federer, should he repeat his Wimbledon heroics, would also complete the \"Golden Grand Slam\" but Graf's record of winning them all in one year may never be equaled. With three different winners of women's grand slams this season it will certainly stand for another four years. \"I think this is a big highlight of anybody's career and I'm pretty sure for anybody that you ask it's a main goal,\" Graf said. Serena Williams has already spoken of her desire to win a third Olympic gold medal in the women's doubles with her elder sister Venus. After her fifth Wimbledon victory last month, the American is a hot favorite to double up - as Venus did in 2000. Meanwhile tennis' golden couple will surely be keeping a keen eye on the action, finding time in between their busy schedule - with their respective foundations and charities - not to mention a busy family life with two very active children. \"A lot of different interests, very active. They keep us on our toes,\" said Graf. \"We're professional babysitters,\" joked Agassi. \"The best job in the world,\" his wife chimed in.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-02 13:11:16", "modified_time": "2012-08-02 17:06:47"}

The tunnels are narrow, the ceilings are low and death is on display. The skulls and bones lining the walls, arranged in a macabre fashion, make up what is known as the Empire of the Dead - the Catacombs of Paris. The catacombs snake below the city, a 321-kilometer (200-mile) network of old quarries, caves and tunnels. Some Parisians are drawn to this largely uncharted territory - a hidden network of adventure, discovery and even relaxation. They are known as 'cataphiles' and the catacombs are their playground. It is a top-secret group. Catacomb entrances are known only to those daring enough to roam the networks on their own - and break the law. Entering unauthorized sections of the catacombs is illegal and a police force is tasked with patrolling the tunnels, and caught cataphiles risk fines of up to 60 euros ($73). But for explorers like Loic Antoine-Gambeaud and his friends, it is a risk they are willing to take. \"I think it's in the collective imagination. Everybody knows that there is something below Paris; that something goes on that's mysterious. But I don't think many people have even an idea of what the underground is like,\" Antoine-Gambeaud said. For those who want to find out, but are not willing to take the risk of going in unsupervised, there is a legal, tourist-friendly public entrance to the catacombs off Place Denfert-Rochereau. Visitors from around the world will queue up to see death on display. \"I think people are fascinated with death,\" one visitor said. \"They don't know what it's about and you see all these bones stacked up, and the people that have come before us, and it's fascinating. We're trying to find our past and it's crazy and gruesome and fun all at the same time.\" But experiencing the history of Paris in an orderly fashion is not the cataphiles' style. Underground, there are plaques echoing the street names above etched into the walls, helping the cataphiles navigate. Often equipped only with head lamps and homemade maps, they explore the tunnels and ancient rooms, sometimes staying underground for days at a time. They throw parties, drink wine, or just relax in a silence they say can't be experienced anywhere else. The catacombs are a by-product of Paris' early development. Builders dug deep underground to extract limestone to build Paris above ground. But the subterranean quarries that were formed proved to be a shaky foundation for the city, causing a number of streets to collapse and be swallowed up by the ground. Eventually, repairs and reinforcements were made, and to this day, the tunnels and quarries are still monitored for safety. The quarries went through several transformations throughout history. Over time, they have served as everything from hiding places for revolutionaries to mushroom farms. In the 18th century the Catacombs became known as the Empire of the Dead. Paris' dead had been buried in cemeteries and beneath churches in the city center, but the number of bodies began to overwhelm the land, breaking through the walls of people's cellars and causing major health concerns. So, beginning in the 1780s, the bodies were transferred in carriages at night to a new, final resting place in the old quarries. In those tunnels there are now the remains of more than six million people. And for the cataphiles, the life among the dead opens up new dreams and possibilities. \"It's like an alternate reality,\" Antoine-Gambeaud said. \"You don't have the same sort of social interaction with people as you do above. You are free to invent yourself again, to be somebody else.\"", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-02 14:52:31", "modified_time": "2012-08-02 14:52:31"}

It would be nice if the Olympics bring people to use the Web to understand each other, break down national and cultural barriers and look at each other from a more beautiful point of view.\" There were more tweets during the opening ceremony of the London Games than during the entire Beijing Olympics in 2008. Many of Facebook's 900 million users shared photos and comments about the event, and took to Twitter-like \"Weibo sites\" to air their takes on the show. Berners-Lee was approached by fellow Brit Danny Boyle - the Oscar-winning film-maker who directed the opening ceremony - last year about making an appearance. During the dazzling \"Frankie and June say ... Thanks Tim\" segment of the show, a British pop music-filled tribute to the digital revolution, the house that was the centerpiece of the act levitated off the ground to reveal Berner-Lee sitting at a computer. Berners-Lee then sent his message - Boyle's idea, according to the scientist - which lit up more than 70,000 LED panels around the stadium and was re-tweeted more than 10,000 times online. \"I was honored to be asked but it was also amazing to be part of this huge piece of amateur drama with thousands of people on stage,\" Berners-Lee said. \"We only had three run-throughs (of the ceremony), but luckily I had probably the simplest part anybody has ever had in any show ever. I had to basically press \"run,\" type a little and it's done. It was a bit nerve-wracking but very exciting.\" Berners-Lee wouldn't bite when asked about the irony of American commentators not knowing who he was and instructing viewers to look him up on the Web. \"If you haven't heard of him, we haven't either,\" declared NBC's Meredith Vieira before co-commentator Matt Lauer told viewers in America to \"Google him.\" Berners-Lee refused to criticize NBC for the gaffe, and said: \"I am terrible at remembering people and places myself, so I can't really blame anyone for that.\" Born and raised in London, Berners-Lee said his invention was \"one of the many things in the show that Britain can be proud of - and an essential thing of it was that it was an open thing, it wasn't something that could be controlled by any one government.\" Berners-Lee, who co-founded and is the director of both and the - devoted to improving and furthering the potential of the Web - has called for governments to be more transparent in how they release data, and is also critical of government censorship of information on the internet. \"Censorship is generally a bad thing. A strong government is one which is able to allow the people in a country to access reality, go onto the internet and see and discuss how things really are,\" he told CNN. \"A more weak government is one that's so worried it has to control info from its own citizens - I think that's a pity when and where it happens. And I think with time we'll see that go away, bit by bit. I think we'll see information get around these blocks. And after awhile governments realize that for the country to work, economically, it's got to be open.\" His message during the may have been \"for everyone,\" but Berners-Lee is quick to point out that the Web is only used by a quarter of the world's population. \"Is it really for everyone? Only 25% of people (globally) use the Web and the other 75% don't,\" he said. \"It's a question of how fast can we actually get the other 75% as part of the information society.\" Berners-Lee says the Web Foundation is focused on closing that gap. \"The Web Foundation is working with other foundations to see what we can to do get people using the web on mobile, to get entrepreneurs in Africa building websites, to get people to be able to pick their villages up from poverty,\" he said. Much like the development of the Web, Berners-Lee believes the 2012 Olympics will be remembered for the tremendous collaboration of volunteers. And while isn't the world's biggest micro-blogger, he says his opening ceremony tweet got him another 50,000 followers on Twitter. \"I should tweet more - I tend to tweet when I see things related to the open web,\" he laughs, \"but I don't tweet about what I had for breakfast.\" CNN's Kristi Lu Stout and Tom McGowan contributed to this report.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-03 04:03:05", "modified_time": "2012-08-03 07:15:27"}

Authorities announced last week that Rebekah Brooks - who besides being a onetime chief executive of News International, which is the division of News Corp. that includes the company's British newspapers, also had been editor of The News of the World tabloid - was among those being charged in the high-profile case. On Thursday evening, she \"answered bail\" at Lewisham police station in the British capital and \"was charged\" with several offenses, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a written statement. She posted bail and is scheduled to next appear in court on September 3. The long-running police investigation prompted by illegal eavesdropping at the defunct Murdoch tabloid The News of the World has expanded into probes of computer hacking, bribery and corruption. Brooks served as that newspaper's editor before taking the same role at The Sun and eventually rising to the CEO position with News International. The announced names of the suspected hacking victims include some of the world's biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jude Law, Paul McCartney and soccer star Wayne Rooney. The phone-hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism, led to the major tabloid's closing and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Murdoch. Others charged in the case include Andy Coulson, an editor at News of the World who went on to become director of communications for British Prime Minister David Cameron before resigning. According to Thursday's release from London police, Brooks was charged on three offenses. The first claims that she - along with Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, Greg Miskiw, Ian Edmondson, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup - conspired between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006, \"to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority.\" Specifically, the charge asserts that they listened to \"voice mail messages of well-known people.\" Another charge accuses Brooks, Coulson, Kuttner, Miskiw, Thurlbeck and Glenn Mulcaire of intercepting messages of Milly Dowler, the 13-year-old British schoolgirl who was abducted and murdered in 2002. Lastly, Brooks, Mulcaire and Miskiw are charged with, between December 3, 2002, and January 22, 2003, conspiring to intercept the messages of firefighter trade union boss Andy Gilchrist. Brooks has previously vigorously denied the charges against her, saying she was \"distressed and angry.\" The scandal exploded with the revelation that the phone of Dowler was hacked after she disappeared in 2002. She was later found murdered. Indications that her voice mail had been accessed had given her parents the false hope she was still alive. Prosecutors allege there were more than 600 victims of phone hacking between 2000 and 2006. The investigation and public notoriety have been damaging to News Corp. and to Murdoch, who stepped down from a string of company boards of directors in July and further distanced himself from the print business that first brought him fame and fortune.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-02 20:47:20", "modified_time": "2012-08-03 01:05:52"}

The French Open champion triumphed 6-2 7-5 to end the Belgian's hopes of a first major championship on the hallowed grass of Wimbledon before she retires for a second time at the end of this year. \"It's a nice experience every time you go out on Centre Court so I'm happy to say that my last match at Wimbledon was on Centre Court,\" the 29-year-old Clijsters said.

Chester Crown Court Judge Roderick Evans sentenced Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed to life in prison. He said the couple, who were originally from Pakistan, must be imprisoned for at least 25 years before being eligible for parole. The sentence came hours after the court found them guilty of murder in the death of Shafilea Ahmed. The girl's dismembered body was found on a riverbank in February 2004, months after she disappeared in 2003. The death was the final act in a long-running effort by the couple to get their daughter to conform to their beliefs, Detective Superintendent Geraint Jones told reporters. \"When this failed, they murdered her, a vile and disgraceful act,\" he said. In sentencing the couple, Evans said they had used \"intimidation, bullying and ... physical violence\" in an effort to force her to adopt ways they viewed as more culturally appropriate. \"Your problem was that, in what you referred to as your 'community,' Shafilea's conduct was bringing shame upon you and your concern about being shamed in your community was greater than your love of your child,\" Evans told the couple, according to a transcript provided by court officials. \"In order to rid yourselves of that problem, you killed Shafilea by suffocating her in the presence of your other four children.\" Melissa Powner, a friend of the slain girl, told reporters the conviction \"brought our friend the justice she deserves.\" \"If there is one thing that we pray will come from this, it is that her beautiful face and tragic story will inspire others to seek help and make them realize that this kind of vile treatment, no matter what culture or background they are from, is not acceptable and there is a way out,\" Powner said in a statement to reporters. The conviction and sentencing came just days after the girl's mother changed her long-standing denials and testified Monday that she had seen her husband attack their daughter on the night Shafilea died. Iftikhar Ahmed has denied killing his daughter. On Monday, Farzana Ahmed testified that she had tried to intervene to protect the girl, but her husband pushed her away and punched her, according to CNN affiliate ITV. She said she was \"extremely scared\" when she fled the room and stayed in a bedroom with other children until she heard a car leaving 20 minutes later. When her husband returned alone, she said, she asked where her daughter was. \"If you care for your dear life and that of your children, don't ever ask me this question again,\" he told her, ITV reported. Farzana Ahmed testified Monday that only one of their children, Mevish, was present when she saw her husband attacking Shafilea. Another of the couple's children, Alesha, testified last month that she saw her parents kill her sister. Alesha said her parents were angry that Shafilea was wearing a short-sleeved, V-neck top, and no sweater, on the night she was killed. \"Just end it here,\" Farzana said to Iftikhar, according to their daughter. They pushed Shafilea onto a sofa and suffocated the struggling girl, Alesha testified. Prosecutor Andrew Edis called it \"an act of suffocation by both parents acting together.\" Police will review evidence that came out during trial and could decide to seek additional charges, Detective Chief Inspector Chris Ankers said. \"It's clear that there are a lot of things in play here,\" he said. Prosecutor Helen Morris used the verdict as an opportunity to urge others who may be suffering or fearful of similar violence and abuse to come forward and \"put your faith in the criminal justice system.\" So-called honor killings, in which members of a family kill relatives because of behavior that they say shames the family, claim about 5,000 lives a year around the world, according to the United Nations Population Fund. In England, the Crown Prosecution Service handled 234 crimes involving alleged \"honor violence\" in 2011. About half resulted in convictions.

The case has been called one of Spain's largest operations against al Qaeda, according to Spanish Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz. The investigation is now focusing on finding the explosives that the three suspects may have hidden, police sources said. Spanish police were searching a construction company in Gibraltar. The Interior Ministry said the men were \"ready to act in Spain and Europe.\" One of the men is Turkish, and the other two are believed to be of Russian-Chechen origin. Police sources said they had gathered enough explosives to \"blow up a bus.\" Authorities later identified the Turkish national as Cengiz Yalcin, and the others are Ahmad Avar and Muhammad Adamov. Avar, who was apparently once apart of Russia's Army Special Forces, an expert in poison and a trained sniper, is thought to be the head suspected al Qaeda cell. He had been living in Spain for two months, police said. Adamov, authorities say, had received \"intensive training in the camps of Afghanistan where he became an expert in managing explosives.\" He is also suspected to have had a hand in the recent Moscow bombings. The two Chechen men arrested Wednesday were on a bus traveling to France when police detained them. Authorities say they \"resisted fiercely.\" Police sources added that they were stopped in Almuradiel, a town about midway between Madrid and the country's southern coast. The third was held in the province of Cadiz on Spain's southern coast. Yalcin said Friday that he had no knowledge of explosive substances found during a search of his home, according to source briefed on the court proceedings. He added that he enjoys ultralight aircraft and remote-controlled airplanes, had equipment in his home used for three motor-powered paragliders and had wanted to teach his Chechen friends how to fly them. Authorities say they believe Yalcin had been the logistics man of the group, and had been living legally in Spain where he worked for a construction company in Gibraltar. The two Chechen men claimed that they were in Spain to apply for political asylum, and one acknowledged that he had been in Afghanistan, the source said. All three have denied al Qaeda links. Prosecutors have asked to be allowed to hold the Chechens for two more days to allow police to root out more evidence in their investigation, partly because certain intelligence exchanges are not considered admissible in court. Police are currently trying to unlock the contents of 32 GB thumb drive that belongs to one of the Chechen suspects, according to Fernando Reinares, a senior international terrorism analyst at The Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid, who was briefed by Spanish security services on the investigation. There are indications from intelligence developed in the investigation that one of the Chechen men attended a Lashkar e Taiba training camp, Reinares said. The group is a Pakistan-based militant organization accused of multiple high-profile attacks, particularly those against neighboring India. Authorities think France may have been the first target of the cell because suspects were traveling there. Spanish and French intelligence officials are still analyzing a laptop and documents located in the apartment of the Turkish suspect in San Roque, Cadiz. The investigation is in its early stages, but Spanish security services have said that the men were most likely plotting to attack the joint U.S.-Spanish naval base at Rota or British interests in Gibraltar, according to Reinares.

The 32-year-old, who retired from tennis in March, was famed for his fearsome forehand during 13 years on the pro circuit, winning 11 ATP Tour titles. However, it is the full set of medals from the Games that he counts as his finest achievement in the sport. The Athens Olympics of 2004 yielded gold in the men's doubles with partner Nicolas Massu, and a bronze in the singles as his compatriot won that competition too - becoming the only man to claim both titles at the same Games. Four years later, in Beijing, Gonzalez reached the showpiece singles final but was thwarted in his bid for a second gold by Rafael Nadal. While the Spaniard was not able to defend his title at London 2012 due to injury, Gonzalez returned to the world's biggest sporting extravaganza in an ambassadorial role. \"I always wanted to play the Olympics,\" he told CNN's Open Court. \"I got there with Nicolas thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. It is not like the other sports. \"It was something really special to us because we had been used to the tour and spending time with the other tennis players, but this time we were with other athletes and it was very exciting because you could see the different kinds of bodies in the same place.\" Gonzalez and Massu's gold rush provoked a surge of pride and patriotism back in Chile, which the pair could only get a true taste of when they returned home as national heroes. That they had to wait over a month to feel the country's full embrace, due to the U.S. Open coming swiftly after the Games, only made their homecoming more sweet. \"When we went back three or four weeks later it was huge,\" said the man dubbed \"Gonzo\" and \"Stone Hand.\" \"The president received us at the government palace. We had breakfast with him and we went out unto the balcony, which is a very popular background where very few people walk out on. \"And there was a lot of people, a few thousand people. It was very exciting and I never dreamed that tennis could give me the chance to have that experience.\" After his heroics in 2004, Gonzalez had the ultimate honor bestowed upon him prior to the start of the Beijing Games when he was asked to carry Chile's flag for the opening ceremony. \"It was one of my best moments because you are an ambassador for your country in the world,\" he said. \"For me it feels like to win something important. It is really huge.\" The only other tennis player to fulfill the same role for his nation in China was 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer, who defeated Gonzalez in the only major final he ever made - at the 2007 Australian Open. Gonzalez turned professional in 1999 and took his first ATP Tour title the year after, his rapier-like forehand cementing his reputation as one of the hottest young players on the circuit. He reached his first grand slam quarterfinal in 2005 at Wimbledon and made the season-ending ATP Tour Finals, contested by the world's top eight players. He subsequently made the last eight of every major tournament, while the four titles he clinched on home soil, in Vina del Mar, also rank as a career highlight. But it is the success Gonzalez has enjoyed on the international stage that has come to define his career, both in a litany of Davis Cup matches with Chile and at the Olympics. Despite the country's fervent love of football, Gonzalez always had his heart set on a career on the baseline rather than the touchline. \"In the beginning I just wanted to see tennis. I went to go see some cups and I feel the passion of the sport and then I went to see the national team of football, but I always wanted to go and play tennis. \"Then one thing led to another and I wanted to play tennis and I wanted to represent my country and you know the passion that the people of Chile gave me was really important for my career.\" It has been less than six months since Gonzalez called time on his career and, though he says he doesn't miss the grueling travels schedule and endless hotel pit-stops, the Chilean admits he will miss that feeling of being on court in front of thousands of fans. But his dual love for the game and his country will also dominate his future, as he plans to help promote tennis in Chile through his foundation and broaden access for those who haven't had the chance to play. \"In Chile there is a lot of talent but maybe the people do not know they have the talent. There are many good football players playing in Europe at a really good level and I think in tennis we can do something similar,\" he said. \"Not like them, but we can do really well. But also I want to be involved in tennis. I have a few offers to start to work with but I want to take my time. \"It is the first time in my life to have enough time for me, so I'm going to start next year. I love tennis and I will stay around.\" And as for his most treasured possessions, where does he keep his hat-trick of Olympic medals? \"They are at my house in the closet,\" he replies. \"Some people come to my house and say, 'Show me them,' but they don't care about the rest, they care about the medals.\"", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-03 16:56:44", "modified_time": "2012-08-19 15:10:13"}

Alfred Hitchcock is feted as the man behind \"Psycho,\" \"The Birds,\" \"Vertigo\" and \"Rear Window\" - but before he made the move stateside, Hitchcock was one of the biggest names in Britain's film industry, and traces of the director and his films can be found across his native city. The British Film Institute has spent the past three years restoring nine of Hitchcock's little-known - and little-seen - silent movies, which can now be viewed on the big screen for the first time in almost 80 years. To celebrate, join CNN on a tour of Hitchcock's London ... Alfred Hitchcock was born above his family's greengrocer's shop in , east London in 1899. Sadly, little trace remains of his early life there: His birthplace, at , was demolished many years ago to make way for a gas station and fast food outlet, though eagle-eyed visitors may notice a plaque on the spot. As a young boy, an unknowing Hitchcock was sent to the local with a note asking the officer on duty to lock him in a cell briefly to warn him what happened to people who misbehaved. Unfortunately, the police station too has been knocked down, but information boards at the site retell the story. There is evidence of the director's links with the area, though: Two modern blocks of flats - \"\" and \"\" take their names from his films, and a pub - on the edge of Epping Forest - is named in his honor. But visitors wanting to catch a glimpse of the city's most colorful tribute to the filmmaker need only step off the underground train: Leytonstone's - on the Central Line - is decorated with featuring . Hitchcock married his long-term collaborator Alma Reville at in upmarket Kensington in December 1926. Mass is still celebrated in Latin every day at the near the Victoria and Albert Museum. The couple lived close by, at in Earl's Court, from 1926 until they and their daughter Patricia left for Hollywood shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. A blue plaque marks the building. Hitchcock began his cinematic career as a designer, creating the title cards used in silent films, but within five years he was directing the movies themselves. For the rest of his life, he would use London as the setting for many of his films: Some of the city's most famous landmarks serve as backdrops to the action. \"London was his base, even after he had moved to the U.S. and was working in Hollywood. It was the location for many of his films, and it was the subtext that ran through them,\" said Sandra Shevey, who runs a regular . \"He wanted to show the gory, nasty bits of the city, like the earthy Cockney he always was,\" she told CNN. \"He used London as the prism through which to show the evils of the world, just like Dickens did.\" Hitchcock's first big hit came with \",\" (1927) the tale of a serial killer, subtitled \"A Story of the London Fog.\" While many of the scenes were filmed in the studio,, the and all make an appearance in the film. Nathalie Morris, Hitchcock expert at the , recommends another location from \"The Lodger\" which she says crops up again and again, not only in his movies, but in his life: , the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, the force responsible for the capital. \"Hitchcock was a regular visitor to Scotland Yard - he would visit the ',' the police's crime museum for inspiration, to lap up plenty of macabre details for his films,\" Morris told CNN. The museum, which opened in 1875, is home to a grisly selection of criminal evidence from notorious cases including those of Jack the Ripper and Dr Crippen. It is no longer open to the public, instead being used for police and forensic science training. Another museum played a more direct role in Hitchcock's final silent film - and first 'talkie' - \"\" (1929). The movie's climactic chase scene takes place across the domed glass roof of the 's old reading room. \"Blackmail\" is one of Morris's top picks for film fans on the lookout for London links to Hitchcock: Other scenes take place in , and . Morris also highlights 1936's \",\" one of the final movies Hitch made before moving to the U.S. in 1939. Opening at the then-newly-built (now little more than a shell of a building), the film is a filmic feast of the city's tourist hotspots: Trafalgar Square, and all feature, alongside one of the director's favorite restaurants, . The interior shots of were filmed in the studio. Sadly, as with many of the locations linked to the director's life, these have since been demolished, but at the site of the former in Islington - now transformed into an apartment complex - a huge sculpture of Hitchcock's head (by artist Antony Donaldson) commemorates his time there. Even after he had left the UK, Hitchcock frequently returned to London to film. Interestingly, Morris points out that he was not actually present when one of the most memorable London scenes in his work was captured on film: The assassin's fatal fall from the belltower of in \".\" \"Deaths from a height are such an important Hitchcockian motif, but because the war was on, Hitchcock could not come to London, and so it was filmed by a second unit,\" she said. The byzantine-style Catholic cathedral would also play another role in Hitchcock's life, some four decades later: It was the location of a memorial service for the director, following his death in 1980. For Shevey, Hitchcock's key London films are \",\" \",\" and \",\" all of which, she says, feature \"some of the most beautiful buildings in London,\" from and the to and . \"Frenzy\" in particular is rooted in its London location, the old fruit and vegetable market and the streets and pubs nearby: The Globe, in Bow Street, and the Nell of Old Drury in Catherine Street. It would be his last movie made in the city \"'Frenzy' was his homecoming film,\" Morris told CNN. \"It brings him full circle, back to the London of 'The Lodger.'\" If all this has wetted your appetite, then head to the, which is currently showing an entire \"\" season featuring all of the director's surviving movies, including those .

Spanish security services suspect their plan may have been to attack the British territory on the southernmost tip of Spain from the air. While their planned date of attack is still not clear, any attack on British soil during the Olympic Games would have generated intense global publicity. A paragliding instructor told police Saturday that Cengiz Yalcin, the alleged cell's Turkish facilitator, requested to be able to take pictures of a Gibraltar shopping mall \"at all cost,\" said Fernando Reinares, a senior international terrorism analyst who was briefed by Spanish security services on the investigation. Yalcin, who worked as an engineer at a contruction company on Gibraltar, was arrested in La Linea de la Concepcion, a town bordering Gibraltar. He had lived in Spain with his Moroccan wife for several years. Explosives were found in his residence, as well as videos and photos suggesting the possibility of attack preparations, Reinares said. Spanish security suspect the cell was testing a remote-controlled plane as a potential bomber. Spanish investigators found a video in which Yalcin was flying a remote-controlled airplane, according to Reinares. The footage showed the plane, which was about three meters long. being maneuvered into a descent. Two packets were then seen dropping from either wing of the plane following his command. \"In the images he can't help expressing his joy for the successful try,\" Reinares told CNN. \"Terrorist innovate and adapt to security measures, we have to always keep this in mind,\" he added. It is not the first time that terrorists have sought to use remote controlled aircraft in terrorist plots. In July Rezwan Ferdaus, a Massachusetts resident inspired by al Qaeda's ideology, pleaded guilty to a September 2011 plot to fly a remote-controlled plane into the Pentagon and U.S. capitol with high explosive. Two Chechen-Russians - Eldar Magomedov (also known as Ahmad Avar) and Muhammad Adamov - whom Spanish security services suspect had been tasked with carrying out an attack, were arrested on a bus travelling towards France. Investigating Judge Judge Pablo Ruz ruled Sunday there was sufficient evidence to unconditionally detain both men. They were charged with membership in a terrorist group and possession or storage of explosives. Yalcin stands accused of possession of explosives substances. According to a statement released Sunday from Ruz, the Chechens hid their true identity after they were arrested, but Spanish authorities were able to establish their real names after help from Russian authorities. The judge noted that U.S. authorities and Gibraltar law enforcement also assisted the Spanish investigation. The arrests were announced Thursday. Experts say the men appear to have constituted one of the most skilled and experienced terror cells seen in recent times, and appear to have been dispatched by al Qaeda to carry out an ambitious attack in Europe. Magomedov, the suspected leader, was a former member of Spetsnaz, the Russian special forces, according to Spain's Interior Ministry. He had training as a sniper and was an expert in poisons, the ministry said. Reinares, of Madrid's Elcano Royal Institute, said that according to information passed to Spain by several Western intelligence agencies, Megomedov joined training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including camps run by Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, after leaving the Russian special forces outfits. According to this intelligence, between 2008 and 2011 Megomedov operated in the southwestern Russian republic of Dagestan and the Pakistani tribal districts of North and South Waziristan, transiting between them, Reinares told CNN. Adamov, the other Chechen, had received explosives training in Afghanistan, where he become an expert in managing explosives and may have participated in a recent bomb attack in Moscow, according to Spanish authorities. According to Reinares, the French described the Chechens to their Spanish counterparts as \"really dangerous.\" He said British intelligence services were also involved in tracking the suspected terrorist cell. Also found in Yalcin's home was equipment for three motorized paragliding machines. Yalcin told a Spanish investigating judge Friday that he was an enthusiast of motorized paragliding and wished to teach his two Chechen associates how to fly them. Reinares said Spanish security services have established that both Chechens received motor-paragliding lessons near La Linea and may have had some instruction before arriving in Spain. A paragliding hand book in Russian was found in their possession, Reinares said. Yalcin, the Turkish suspect, was ordered detained immediately after his arrest. Because information obtained by intelligence agencies is generally not admissable in Spanish courts, Spanish police and security services had scramble in the past few days to provide sufficient evidence to bring a case, according to Reinares. French security services tipped off their Spanish counterparts about the probable arrival of the two Chechen suspected terrorists in May, according to Reinares. The French had been tracking the duo and monitoring their phone calls. At one point, they intercepted a phone call in which the Chechens described Spain as a \"more easy country to get explosives,\" Reinares said. Investigators moved to arrest all three men after the two Chechens appeared to be heading back to France by bus, concerned that France may be their target. One of them violently resisted arrest, the Spanish Interior Ministry reported. But police were frustrated by a judge's refusal to grant an immediate search warrant for Yalcin's apartment after his arrest, according to Reinares. Investigators feared that may have given the cell time to dispose of additional explosives, he said. It took eight to nine hours for the search warrant to be granted. Police then drove with Yalcin and an official of the Spanish judiciary to his residence. According to the subsequent judicial report, his wife greeted him by saying \"do not worry, honey, I cleaned it all.\" The agents wrote they noticed a \"very strong smell of bleach when moving into the place,\" the report said. Reinares said French security services had asked their Spanish counterparts not to share intelligence on the suspected cell with the Spanish judiciary, fearing that open exposure of such information in court - as required by Spanish law - could blow the whole operation. Dog teams used in the search suggested that more explosives had been present than police found, according to Reinares. Spanish security services believe another target of the alleged terrorist cell may have been a joint U.S.-Spanish naval base in Rota, Spain, near where they were based, and have not ruled out other possible targets in Europe. \"The case definetely stresses, once again, how critical cooperation between Western nations is to successfully prevent and combat international terrorism,\" Reinares told CNN.

It was unbelievable,\" Bradley told the PGA Tour's official website. \"I got behind it, and I barely even had to read it. I knew the exact way it was going to break. I just needed to hit it hard enough. I knew that. And it was dead center.\" Bradley's victory at the U.S. PGA Championship saw him join Ben Curtis and Francis Ouimet as only the third player in golf to have won on their major championship debut. Coupled with his win at the 2011 HP Byron Nelson Championship, Bradley's efforts saw him crowned as the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. But even though Bradley comes into the final major of the year with the spotlight firmly on him, he insists it will be business as usual. \"I'm not preparing any differently,\" Bradley said. \"The biggest key is to keep everything constant, what I've always done. I feel as though I'm doing that. \"And about this time last year, is when I really started to get it rolling, and I went on about a six or seven month stretch of great golf. I love these golf courses at the end of the year... It's just an exciting time of the year.\" The thrilling nature of Bradley's victory at the Atlanta Athletic Club propelled him into the limelight, and he heads for Kiawah Island's Ocean Course with experience in three more majors under his belt. But he won't be studying videos of his triumph before he tees off on Thursday, looking to retain a trophy that bears the names of Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods among others. \"I'm not able to watch the replays of the PGA,\" he said, \"I get too nervous. Part of me is amazed that it happened. \"I think back on it, and I think about how different my life would be if I didn't win that PGA or if I lost that playoff. It's kind of a brutal thing to think about. But life has changed a lot in terms of at golf tournaments. \"It's not changed at all off the golf course with my buddies and my friends. I enjoy all that comes with winning major championships and tournaments, but I try to keep everything the same. \"There are specific things that have changed dramatically, but I try to keep my life the same. I mean, I'm the same kid that grew up in Boston and Vermont that I am now.\" I'm not able to watch the replays of the PGA. I get too nervous. Part of me is amazed that it happened Keegan Bradley More majors are in Bradley's sights but once the PGA Championship is out of the way he will be hoping to focus fully on the Ryder Cup, and trying to help the United States team beat Europe. His victory at the Bridgestone all but secured his place as one of eight automatic slots on Captain Davis Love III's team and Bradley admits it is something he would love to be a part of. \"I'm thinking about it,\" admitted Bradley. \"I'm trying not to think about it. But it's definitely on my mind at all times. \"Captain Davis Love has really reached out to me and given me some advice, and told me to take it one shot at a time and get into the process of playing each tournament and each shot. \"You know, it's difficult, because I just missed out on the Presidents Cup last year, so I really want this pretty bad, and that can be a negative. So if I just play OK, I'm going to get into that top eight spots.\"", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-06 21:20:32", "modified_time": "2012-08-06 21:20:32"}
{"url": ["https://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/06/sport/football/olympic-sailing-london-guide/index.html"], "title": "London 2012 Olympics: sailing guide", "content": "is CNN's monthly sailing show, exploring the sport of sailing, luxury travel and the latest in design and technology.Sailing made its Olympic debut at the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900In the London 2012 Olympics 380 sailors from 63 countries are competingThe sailing events are divided into ten classes, six for men and four for women Even for a seasoned sailor the Olympic sailing class and point system can be a bit confusing as different boats and crew constellations are given the chance to compete every four years. To try and make sense of it all and to give you the heads up on some of the London 2012 sailing favorites, CNN's MainSail crew have put together a guide to this summer's sailing events. Sailing made its Olympic debut in Paris during the 1900 Games and since then the sport has appeared in every Olympic Games, with the exception of St Louis in 1904, making it one of the oldest sports on the Olympic program. Unlike the early Olympic Games where sailing was dominated by big boats with up to 12 sailors, today's classes feature small boats with up to three crew members. Since 1900 more than 40 different sailing classes have taken part in the Olympic Games and some golden oldies like the Dragon and the Flying Dutchman have had to give way for today's modern classes. \"The reason classes keep changing so much is down to the advances made in the equipment used and the latest developments in the sport,\" said Daniel Smith, press officer at the International Sailing Federation (ISAF). In keeping with the ever changing class system, only six events from the London 2012 Games program have made it through to the 2016 Games in Rio - where the biggest shocker in the sailing community was that news that . Sailing is unique in the sense that women have always been allowed to compete with men in the Olympics, but this changed for the Seoul 1988 Olympics where separate events were introduced exclusively for women. In the London 2012 Olympic Games the sailing events are divided into ten classes - six for men and four for women. This summer's Games will be the first Olympics at which sailing has no \"open class\" - where men and women can compete against each other. Things will change again for the Rio Games, where the mixed class - in which men and women compete in the same team - is making a comeback in form of the new \"mixed two person multihull\" event. There are two disciplines - match racing (one against one), fleet racing (mass start) - featured in the London 2012 Olympics. Only one out of ten events, the Women's Elliott 6m class, is using the match racing format. In match racing teams compete against each other in a series of round robin matches, with the top teams progressing to the final knockout stages. Fleet racing is slightly more complicated. Each event has a series of races and points are awarded in each race: the first boat scores one point, second scores two points and so on. After ten races (15 races in the Skiff event) each boat is allowed to discard its worst score and the ten boats with the lowest accumulated scores qualify for the medal race. In the final race, points are doubled and added to the opening series' scores to decide the top ten positions. The athlete or crew with the lowest number of points is the winner. This summer 380 sailors (237 men and 143 women) from 63 countries will compete in the Olympic sailing events. The home nation currently tops the overall Olympic medal tally. Team GB is expected to win medals in more or less every event but with great teams and individuals sailors from Australia, the U.S., France and Brazil the elusive gold medals could be anyone's for the taking. One of the fiercest rivalries this summer is between British sailor Paul Goodison and Australian Tom Slingsby in the men's Laser event. Goodison won gold in the Beijing 2008 Olympics beating Slingsby who was the favorite at the time. Since then Slingsby has come back with a vengeance and has beaten Goodison at all major events, and the pair who used to be good friends are no longer on speaking terms. Australia's Nathan Outteridge and Iain Jensen are the favorites in the men's two person 49er class. They are the world number ones, the reigning world champions and currently unbeaten at the London 2012 sailing venue. Another likely golden Aussie crew consists of Malcolm Page and Mathew Belcher who are competing in the men's 470 event. Since the 2008 Olympics they have won the world title every year.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-06 11:38:17", "modified_time": "2012-08-06 11:38:17"}

The world No. 1 was pipped to the London 2012 crown by Britain's Andy Murray - the man Federer beat to secure his seventh Wimbledon title just over a month ago. The 30-year-old has won 17 grand slams in his illustrious career and took gold in the doubles with Stanislas Wawrinka in Beijing four years ago, but he has failed to win the singles title in four attempts. Despite the disappointment he felt at being brushed aside 6-2 6-1 6-4 by Murray and missing out on topping the podium, Federer did at least claim his first solo medal. \"I'm not sure yet, it's four years away. I can retire in the meantime and come again!\" Federer told CNN about his hopes of an Olympic appearance in Brazil. \"But I'm not going to do that, I'm going to keep on playing. I hope I can do it. I'm turning 31 in a few days, so I'll be 35 for Rio - I think it's possible but we'll see how it goes.\" A gold medal would have capped a perfect month for Federer, after his victory at Wimbledon catapulted him back to the top of the world rankings. And once the bitter sting of defeat on Centre Court had subsided, Federer insisted finally getting his hands on a singles medal tempered the disappointment of his straight-sets loss. \"I'd have to say I was very disappointed for three to five minutes,\" he said. \"I was in a little room waiting for the ceremony, I saw Del Potro and Murray and I saw how happy they were for gold, for bronze. \"Of course I'd just lost my match where Del Potro had to win the bronze over Djokovic. So I was in the middle and I was the only one who'd lost that day. \"I thought, 'Hmmm, I could either be sad right now, extremely sad, or extremely proud and happy,' and I chose to be extremely happy and proud. \"It was a dream summer for me. I won Wimbledon and I returned to world No. 1 and I tried everything I could to win Olympic gold, and I just came up against a better player on the day. \"So for me silver is the maximum I could get out of the Olympics this time around. I was just extremely happy, like a little kid there on the podium.\" Murray's victory offered the Scot recompense for his heartbreaking defeat in the Wimbledon final - the first time a British male had reached the showpiece event since 1938. The 25-year-old beat former world No. 1 Novak Djokovic on his way to the final, and also claimed silver in the mixed doubles with Laura Robson. And Federer paid tribute to his rival for winning his first major tennis title less than a month after losing his fourth grand slam final. \"I thought he played great,\" Federer said. \"What a champion, to come back from losing in the finals of Wimbledon, resting, preparing. \"With the pressure, okay he had home advantage - you can see that as an advantage or a disadvantage - but for him to come back and win the Olympics, people sort of expected him to maybe do that. I'm turning 31 in a few days, so I'll be 35 for Rio - I think it's possible but we'll see how it goes Roger Federer \"But he came through Djokovic and through me, who he lost to at the finals at Wimbledon, that's the sign of a champion. \"I always knew he had it in him but it was good to see he didn't let his head hang and was disappointed and upset and sour about his loss at Wimbledon. \"He should have been proud of it and that's what I told him then. I hope he enjoys this victory like he should because it was a big victory for him.\" Federer admitted his challenge for the gold was dampened by his marathon semifinal against Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro - the longest in Olympic history at four hours and 26 minutes. The deciding set was eventually won 19-17 by Federer but the Swiss refused to blame tiredness for his lackluster performance. \"I missed a lot of opportunities, I think I made zero of nine break points and he made four out of 10. We weren't that far away from each other but he pulled away,\" he said. \"I think with the crowd he got momentum and it was hard to stop. Maybe emotionally I was a bit drained, or physically a bit slow at times after the Del Potro match, but I had a day to rest so no excuses, he was the better player on the day. \"I have regrets, a little bit, but I tried everything I could but it wasn't enough.\"", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-06 21:35:19", "modified_time": "2012-08-06 21:35:19"}

Police deduced this from the declaration of a paragliding instructor who had dealings with the group and the contents of a video they recovered from the suspects, according to Fernando Reinares, a senior international terrorism analyst who was briefed by Spanish security services on the investigation. \"Attacking in or near Gibraltar during the Olympic Games apparently was for them a feasible alternative to what they, and their corresponding organizational leadership, perceived as a much more difficult operation, that of attempting an act of terrorism in London,\" Reinares told CNN. While the planned execution date of their alleged plot is still not clear, any attack on or near British soil during the Olympic Games would have generated intense global publicity. Spanish police believe that one of the targets of the alleged cell could have been a commercial complex named \"Puerta de Europa\" in Algeciras, just across the strait of Gibraltar from the British overseas territory, Reinares told CNN. Spanish security services suspect their plan may have been to attack the area around the British territory on the southernmost tip of Spain from the air, Reinares said. A paragliding instructor told police Saturday that Cengiz Yalcin, the alleged cell's Turkish facilitator, asked to be able to take pictures of a Gibraltar shopping mall \"at all cost,\" said Reinares. Spanish security suspect the cell was testing a remote-controlled plane as a potential bomber. Spanish investigators found a video in which Yalcin was flying a remote-controlled airplane, according to Reinares. The footage showed the plane, which was about three meters long, being maneuvered into a descent. Two packets were then seen dropping from either wing of the plane following his command. \"In the images he can't help expressing his joy for the successful try,\" Reinares told CNN. \"Terrorists innovate and adapt to security measures, we have to always keep this in mind,\" he added. It is not the first time that terrorists have sought to use remote controlled aircraft in terrorist plots. In July, Rezwan Ferdaus, a Massachusetts resident inspired by al Qaeda's ideology, pleaded guilty to a September 2011 plot to fly a remote-controlled plane into the Pentagon and U.S. capitol with high explosives. Two Chechen-Russians - Eldar Magomedov, also known as Ahmad Avar, and Muhammad Adamov - whom Spanish security services suspect had been tasked with carrying out an attack, were arrested on a bus traveling toward France. Investigating Judge Pablo Ruz ruled Sunday there was sufficient evidence to unconditionally detain both men. They were charged with membership in a terrorist group and possession or storage of explosives. Yalcin stands accused of possession of explosives substances. According to a statement released Sunday from Ruz, the Chechens hid their true identity after they were arrested, but Spanish authorities were able to establish their real names after help from Russian authorities. The judge noted that U.S. authorities and Gibraltar law enforcement also assisted the Spanish investigation. The arrests were announced Thursday. Experts say the men appear to have constituted one of the most skilled and experienced terrorist cells seen in recent times, and appear to have been dispatched by al Qaeda to carry out an ambitious attack in Europe. Magomedov, the suspected leader, was a former member of Spetsnaz, the Russian special forces, according to Spain's Interior Ministry. He had training as a sniper and was an expert in poisons, the ministry said. Reinares, of Madrid's Elcano Royal Institute, said that according to information passed to Spain by several Western intelligence agencies, Magomedov joined training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including camps run by Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, after leaving the Russian special forces outfits. According to this intelligence, between 2008 and 2011, Magomedov operated in the southwestern Russian republic of Dagestan and the Pakistani tribal districts of North and South Waziristan, transiting between them, Reinares said. Adamov, the other Chechen, had received explosives training in Afghanistan, where he become an expert in managing explosives and may have participated in a recent bomb attack in Moscow, according to Spanish authorities. According to Reinares, the French described the Chechens to their Spanish counterparts as \"really dangerous.\" He said British intelligence services were also involved in tracking the suspected terrorist cell. Also found in Yalcin's home was equipment for three motorized paragliding machines. Yalcin told a Spanish investigating judge Friday that he was an enthusiast of motorized paragliding and wished to teach his two Chechen associates how to fly them. Reinares said Spanish security services have established that both Chechens received motor-paragliding lessons near La Linea and may have had some instruction before arriving in Spain. A paragliding hand book in Russian was found in their possession, Reinares said. French security services tipped off their Spanish counterparts about the probable arrival of the two Chechen suspected terrorists in May, according to Reinares. The French had been tracking the duo and monitoring their phone calls. At one point, they intercepted a phone call in which the Chechens described Spain as a \"more easy country to get explosives,\" Reinares said. Investigators moved to arrest all three men after the two Chechens appeared to be heading back to France by bus, concerned that France may be their target. One of them violently resisted arrest, the Spanish Interior Ministry reported.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-07 14:28:11", "modified_time": "2012-08-07 15:42:08"}

There have been 16 different winners in the past 16 majors, and there's nothing to suggest that trend will be broken at this week's PGA Championship at Kiawah Island in South Carolina. Woods, who has climbed back to No. 2 in the rankings, won the season's closing major for the fourth time in 2007 but has been stuck on 14 overall since his U.S. Open victory the following year. The American has won three times on the 2012 PGA Tour to go second on the all-time list, but his tie for third at last month's British Open was his best finish in the first three of golf's four prestige events. \"Golf is getting deep. There's so many guys with a chance to win,\" he told reporters on Tuesday. \"The margin is getting smaller. There may be 16 different winners, but you look at the cuts - the cuts are getting lower.

Bradley, who won last weekend's WGC-Bridgestone Invitational as Woods tied for eighth, has been followed by this year's Masters winner Bubba Watson and U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson. Veteran Ernie Els broke that first-time trend at Royal Lytham last month when he denied Adam Scott his maiden major - the South African claimed his first since 2002 and fourth overall. \"The margins are so small, and if you've got margins that are that small you're going to get guys who win once here and there,\" Woods said. \"If you just make the cut nowadays you're within nine shots of the lead sometimes.

Her masculine build, chiseled abs and deep voice fueled rumors about her gender, sparking an international outcry. Outraged South Africans rushed to her defense and accused the world of invading her privacy. The organization's handling of her case also sparked widespread criticism over accusations that it was unclear what standards the world body was using to determine her gender. \"The questioning of her gender is based on stereotypical view of the physical features and abilities attributable to women. Such stereotypes demonstrate the extent of patriarchy within the world's sporting community,\" South Africa's minister of women, Noluthando Sibiya, said at the time. Officials for track and field's world governing body sidelined her for nearly a year before she was cleared to run against women in 2010 after undergoing gender and drug tests. While the governing body said it had cleared her to run as a woman, it declined to provide medical details on the case, citing confidentiality. \"I am thrilled to enter the global athletics arena once again and look forward to competing with all the disputes behind me,\" Semenya said after her clearance. \"Running is everything to me. When I am running, I am happy.\" In addition to the gender scandal, she has suffered a series of setbacks, including withdrawing from the 2010 Commonwealth Games because of a back injury. She finished second in the 800 meters at the worlds in South Korea last year. But all the firestorm was in the past as Semenya - who is coached by 2000 Sydney Olympics 800m champion Maria Mutola -carried the South African flag in the opening ceremony in London. The powerhouse runner flashed a bright smile as she entered the grandest athletic stage of all.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-08 07:20:03", "modified_time": "2012-08-08 13:07:10"}

The ruling, which came Wednesday, comes as the country is mired in an escalating debate on the status of homosexual partnerships. The court ruled that gay couples who have entered into a \"registered partnership,\" the German legal phrase for relationships similar to marriage, must be exempted from the country's land transfer tax just like straight married couples, according to a court news release. The verdict comes as Germany's politicians are generally debating taxation for same-sex couples. Angela Merkel's governing conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has traditionally been against tax equality for homosexual partnerships. But recently, 13 members of the party called for an expansion of tax rights for same-sex couples. The group wrote that it feels it is not acceptable that \"politics time and again has to be ordered by the constitutional court to abolish inequalities.\" Kristina Schroder, Germany's minister for family affairs and also a member of the CDU, has signaled support for the push, saying, \"the suggestion comes at exactly the right time. In homosexual partnerships, people take long-term responsibility for each other. They are living conservative values,\" she told German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. However, more conservative members of the CDU have voiced concern about the matter, and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said at a recent news conference that he does not see an urgent need to revise the country's tax laws. Vicious criticism has come from the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's CDU, which is also part of Germany's federal government. \"The marriage of man and woman is under special protection because it is fundamentally oriented toward creating new life. This is not the case in homosexual relationships,\" the CSU's whip in Germany's parliament, Gerda Hasselfeldt, told ARD television. The third partner in Germany's governing coalition, the Liberal Democrats, have long been fighting for tax equality for homosexual couples. In a statement on its website, the party says it welcomes additional members of Merkel's party joining its ranks in the debate. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, the former head of the Liberal Democrats, has recently come out as being gay. He lives in a registered partnership with his partner, Michael Mronz. The German government, then under Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, passed a law in August 2001 to create registered partnerships that gave homosexual couple rights similar to those of married couples. But gays and lesbians still face tax inequalities, especially in the field of income taxes. Germany's constitutional court also has cases pending against Germany's current treatment of gays and lesbians in the income tax system.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-09 10:45:18", "modified_time": "2012-08-09 11:09:44"}

In front of 80,203 fans, a record for a women's soccer match at the Games, the U.S. won a fourth Olympic gold in five tournaments thanks to a goal in each half from midfielder Carli Lloyd. Japan beat Pia Sundhage's team in a dramatic penalty shootout at last year's World Cup in Germany, but the Asian team could only offer Yuki Ogimi's second-half goal in response. The U.S. got off to a perfect start when Lloyd met striker Alex Morgan's cross with a brave header after eight minutes. The Japanese, guaranteed a historic first women's football medal after beating France in the semifinals, were angered when a penalty wasn't given for a Tobin Heath handball midway through the first half. After Japan hit the crossbar twice before halftime, Lloyd doubled her tally and the Americans' lead with a stunning solo strike in the 55th minute. The 30-year-old curled a 20-yard shot into the net following a run which began inside her own half. Striker Ogimi offered Japan a lifeline when she bundled a shot into the net after U.S. captain Christie Rampone had failed to clear her lines. Rampone was at fault again when she gifted possession to substitute Mana Iwabuchi, who saw her shot athletically saved by Hope Solo. Japan pushed to find an equalizer but the U.S. held on. It could have been 3-1, but striker Abby Wambach - who finished the tournament with five goals - headed over from a late corner. Canada, beaten 4-3 by the U.S. in a dramatic semifinal, clinched the bronze medal earlier on Thursday by beating France 1-0 in Coventry.

Conte and his Juve assistant Angelo Alessio, who was also at Siena, were suspended by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) following a police investigation over allegations of \"sporting fraud and fraudulent association\" in relation to a league fixture against Novara in April 2011. While earlier charges of direct involvement in match-fixing have been dropped, the FIGC maintain Conte was aware of the corruption taking place during his tenure at Siena. Last season Juventus won the Serie A title for the first time since being stripped of two scudettos and relegated in 2006 after another match-fixing scandal. \"The club underlines its full support for Antonio Conte and Angelo Alessio, in the hope that their innocence will emerge during the appeals process,\" said a Juventus statement. Conte submitted a plea bargain earlier in August, in which he would have had to pay a EUR200,000 ($245,000) fine and serve a three-month suspension, but the FICG rejected a more lenient sanction. The former Juventus captain, 43, led his side to back into the Champions League after managing them through an entire season without suffering a defeat, but came under official investigation in June after his first season at the helm of the Serie A giants. \"He is not being accused of match-fixing himself, and with appeal the sentence may be reduced to five months. It's enormous scandal, and it goes way beyond Conte,\" John Foot, author of \"Calcio: A History of Italian Football,\" told CNN. In total, 13 clubs and 44 members of Italian League football are alleged to have been involved in the betting scandal investigation including Siena, which accepted a six-point deduction last week as part of a plea bargain. Serie B sides Lecce and Grosseto have been excluded from Italy's second division for the 2012-13 season, and their former presidents Giovanni Semeraro and Piero Camilli face five-year suspensions. Six other players - Leonardo Bonucci, Simone Pepe, Marco di Vaio, Salvatore Masiello, Daniele Padelli and Giuseppe Vives -have been acquitted of the charges against them. In May, Italian police descended on the national team's Euro 2012 training base to speak to defender Domenico Criscito as part of a wide-ranging investigation into match fixing. The 25-year-old, formerly of Genoa but now at Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg, was questioned by officials probing gambling markets linked to fixing results of matches in the Italian top flight. A total of 19 people were arrested in the ongoing investigation by magistrates in Cremona, 11 of them players in Italy's top division. \"The top people are still there and no-one has resigned,\" said Foot, Professor of Modern Italian History at University College London. \"The authorities have come close to uncovering the networks a few times in recent years, but they've really got it now. They have found a network that goes to Singapore and China - it's an international network.\" Football's world governing body FIFA is waiting for the FIGC to report on the scandal. \"FIFA is currently waiting to receive all relevant documents from the Italian FA (FIGC) pertaining to the case and will then evaluate the next steps,\" it said. \"This includes the potential extension of sanctions to have worldwide effect, in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code.\" Since February, FIFA has extended 39 domestic sanctions in Turkey, Finland, Korean Republic and Croatia in an attempt to preserve the integrity of the sport. It said that South East Asia is \"widely considered as a center of legal and illegal betting.\" FIFA said it has invested EUR20 million ($24.5 million) as part of a global initiative to clamp down on corruption within football. The scheme targets illegal and irregular betting and match-fixing, which is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year in Asia alone. Friday's announcement of FIGC's punishments are the latest in a long-running saga that has cast a shadow over Italian football. Seventeen people were arrested in a similar swoop last year, the most high-profile of which was Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni. He was subsequently banned from the game for three years.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-10 20:43:21", "modified_time": "2012-08-10 20:43:21"}

But an expert on the Mexican drug war, Malcolm Beith, disputed that assertion. \"They're already operating in Europe,\" he told CNN in a telephone interview, citing reports of the cartel shipping drugs to ports in England, Netherlands and Germany. Spain is the principal gateway for drugs coming to Europe, Beith said. The operation, dubbed \"Dark Waters\" and carried out in collaboration with the FBI, resulted in the arrests in Madrid of four members of the cartel, which is run by Joaquin Guzman Loera, also known as \"El Chapo,\" police said in a statement. Dark Waters was initiated in May 2009 by the FBI's office in Boston, Massachusetts, which was looking into the cartel, said the statement. In October 2010, agents from the FBI met with the National Police's Central Brigade of Organized Crime after learning of the cartel's alleged plans to expand operations in Europe, it said. The bulk of the investigation unfolded in the United States, where U.S. agents discovered that cartel members were planning to travel to Spain, a trip that occurred the following March, the statement said. Once the suspects were inside Spain, they were placed under tight surveillance by Spanish police, it said. \"Thanks to the exchange of information with the FBI, one knew that the suspects planned to initiate important shipments of cocaine by ship, hidden in containers with legal, declared cargo,\" it said. \"They adopted great measures of security to ensure the success of the operations, and sent various containers without any type of drug. Finally, they sent their first shipment in a boat from Brazil. The container, which was intercepted in late July in the Port of Algeciras, concealed 373 kilos of cocaine.\" Investigators identified Jesus Gonzalo Palazuelos Soto, who moved to Madrid to oversee the operation, as a member of the group, it said. A few days later, he was joined by Jesus Gutierrez Guzman, a cousin of \"El Chapo\" and considered the leader of the group; Samuel Zazueta Valenzuela, a principal collaborator, and Rafael Humberto Celaya Valenzuela, who was overseeing the organization's \"legal\" affairs, it said. The four men, aged 37 to 52, were arrested near their hotels in Madrid, it said. They had been sought by U.S. authorities for drug trafficking, money laundering and other charges. Their hotel rooms contained $5,500, about 3,000 euros and 4,000 Mexican pesos, it said. If indeed \"Chapo\" Guzman's cousin was among the men arrested, \"that is a big deal,\" said Beith, whose books \"The Last Narco\" and \"Hasta El Ultimo Dia,\" focus on the Mexican drug war. Though he said he had never heard of the man, \"as a relative, he's clearly an envoy of sorts. He's not just some low-level conejo - rabbit scout.\" Beith said Friday's announcement was a testament to the improvement in intelligence sharing by international agencies. \"As the drug wars come under fire from many quarters, one of the big advances that has been made has been intelligence sharing between U.S. agencies and their foreign counterparts, and this is further proof of that.\"", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-10 20:53:45", "modified_time": "2012-08-11 03:48:08"}

Upon receiving them, we washed them. They have undergone a full examination - all the Russian specialists have examined them, and taken all the analyses.\" She added that laboratory test results on the children's health would be known Friday. The state-run newspaper Russia Today said some were born underground and had never seen daylight. Police say that more than 30 adults lived in the warren of rooms, where three people shared each square meter of living space, according to the state-run news agency RIA Novosti. \"The premises consists of cells without natural light and ventilation located in the basement and foundation and dug into the ground,\" said Irina Petrova, assistant to the state attorney. \"It is an eight-level anthill.\" At least 19 of the children, ages 1 to 17 years, were placed in institutional care while authorities determine whether to return them to their families; others were hospitalized for health checks. Some of the children have no documents, RIA Novosti reported. \"A child involved in a sect becomes a hostage and his or her life is at risk,\" said Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights Pavel Astakhov. \"This violates nearly every one of the child's rights to health, education and normal development. Unfortunately, the victims' rehabilitation usually takes a long time and requires professional assistance. The parents will have to undergo the required treatment before they are allowed to visit their children.\" The sect was literally unearthed August 1 in a suburb of the city of Kazan in Russia's mainly Muslim Tatarstan region during an investigation into militant groups. Police detained some of its members, including its reclusive 83-year-old leader, Faizrakhman Satarov. Some of them are facing charges that include neglect of minors. Russian media reports say Satarov's followers refused to recognize Russian laws or the authority of mainstream Muslim leaders in Tartastan. RIA Novosti said members of the underground sect and their children had spent after nearly a decade living in tight quarters without heat, ventilation, sunlight or proper food. The children had no access to health care or schooling and were discouraged from contacting outsiders, though sexual activity was encouraged, the agency said, adding that one of the children, a 17-year-old girl, was pregnant. Satarov founded the sect in 1964, declaring himself a prophet and his house an independent Islamic state, Ria Novosti reported. In 1966, he bought the property near Kazan, the region's capital, and built the bunker as a religious school, it said. Almost 10 years ago, some 70 Satarov followers cloistered themselves inside and declared themselves an Islamic caliphate, it said. Tatarstan police said that the house, built on 700 square meters, was built illegally and is subject to demolition. \"They have decided to eliminate our community, decided to wage war against Allah,\" sect member Gumer Ganiyev told Vesti TV. \"They won't defeat Allah.\" \"This could just be some 83-year-old who wants to control people,\" said Shireen T. Hunter, a scholar on Islam and Russia who directs the Carnegie Project on Reformist Islam at Georgetown University and has visited the region several times. \"This may have nothing at all to do with radical or extreme Islam as we understand it. This man - creating a caliphate? How is he going to do that? This just doesn't seem like the modus operandi of a serious radical cell bent on challenging the government.\" CNN's Matthew Chance and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-09 23:47:06", "modified_time": "2012-08-10 11:08:50"}

It was one of two simple goals scored by Oribe Peralta which allowed the Mexicans to command a game which was littered with defensive errors by the Brazilians. Brazil could have pulled off a comeback when Hulk scored in injury time and Oscar missed the equalizer with seconds to go. Peralta's record-breaking first goal after just 29 seconds of play was an early example of what was to come. Brazil's defenders made the first of many poor clearances and the striker just accepted the ball outside the Brazilian area to shoot for goal in the bottom corner of the net with a low drive. The much-fancied Brazilians were in shock from the early setback and there was an altercation between Raphael and Juan after the goal as they tried to work out who was to blame for the error which allowed Mexico in. And they struggled to get the ball past a Mexican side happy to defend for the rest of the first period. The Brazilians had 60% of the the goalscoring opportunities, yet they failed to capitalize on every single one. Neymar put a number of shots over the bar and he was joined by attempts by Raphael. Seven minutes into the second half, Brazil's Neymar crashed into the Mexican goalkeeper in the area, but British referee Mark Clattenburg rightly waved away calls for a penalty. The Mexicans seemed to be spurred on in the second half by a series of poor clearances and they fancied getting another goal. Tiago Silva failed to clear the ball from his area and, luckily for the Brazilians, Marco Fabian found it tough to control the ball and his looped shot hit the bar . Peralta looked set for his second goal when he saw off the final defender in the box and shot the ball into the net. However, he was ruled to be offside. He finally made the breakthrough minutes later. As a free kick came in, he had an easy header into the right hand side of the goal from the center of the area as the Brazilians stood like statues. However, in an example of how much the game meant to Brazil, they tried to fashion a last minute comeback and nearly pulled it off. Hulk broke free in injury time with a great low finish through the goalkeeper's legs to make it 2-1 to reignite Brazil's hopes of saving the game. Moments late Oscar had a golden opportunity to equalize but sent his header over the bar. A near capacity crowd 86,162 people came to see the Olympics final at London's Wembley Stadium. Whilst Peralta's first goal broke the Olympic record for the fastest goal, it was not the fastest seen at Wembley.

The club only managed a 2-2 draw in their first game away at Peterhead, a team without any full-time players which has spent much of its time in the bottom division which Rangers have now joined following their collapse with debts of over $200 million earlier this year. In what could have been an embarrassing start to Rangers' life in the lower leagues, Peterhead overturned an opening goal against them and lead 2-1 for most of the second half. The Glasgow side had eight internationals on the pitch and they dominated possession, yet struggled to do anything with the ball until the 90th minute, when Andrew Little tapped home a rebound after Kevin Kyle's header hit the bar. A record crowd of 4,485 packed into the tiny Balmoor stadium -10 times the average attendance at the ground. After the game, Rangers manager Ally McCoist told BBC Radio Scotland: \"I felt we defended appallingly to be honest. We didn't match their aggression and if our boys at any time thought this was going to be a cakewalk they know where they are now. \"I am not going to start panicking but overall I still think we will play better and we'll certainly pass the ball better but enormous credit must go to Peterhead.\" Cash-strapped Rangers went into administration earlier this year and a new company was formed to allow them to continue as a professional team. They were subsequently expelled from the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and had to turn to the lesser SFL for next season. Rangers have been regulars in the European Champions League since its inception. They won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and as recently as 2008 were runners-up in the UEFA Cup (Now Europa League). SPL chief executive Neil Doncaster and his Scottish Football Association counterpart Stewart Regan both lobbied for Rangers to be placed in the SFL Division One so they could secure a quick return to the top flight, but their pleas were ignored.

The Northern Irishman played 27 holes after coming back to the Ocean Course early to complete his third round, after which he had built a three-shot lead. And, in similar fashion to his eight-shot victory at last year's U.S. Open, the 23-year-old showed no nerves as he bounced back after struggling in the season's first three majors. He has won his two majors at a younger age than Tiger Woods did. It was the biggest winning margin since the tournament changed to a strokeplay format in 1958, eclipsing Jack Nicklaus' seven-shot victory 32 years ago. McIlroy broke the streak of 16 different winners in the past 16 majors as he followed his third-round 67 with a six-under-par 66, becoming the first player from his country to win the event. \"It was a great round of golf - I am speechless,\" he told reporters after becoming the fifth youngest player to win the PGA. \"The game-plan was just to play solid.

The Italian has been growing frustrated with City's inability to land his top transfer targets after reportedly becoming angry at the lack of progress being made by sporting director Brian Marwood. After leading City to their first league title since 1968, Mancini is keen to bolster his squad with the prize of the European Champions League now a top priority. City spent close to $785m in transfers over the past four years but has been virtually inactive during recent months while their rivals continue to buy. European champions Chelsea has spent $50m on Belgium midfielder Eden Hazard as well as $39m on Brazil midfielder Oscar. Arsenal has also been recruiting new talent with Lukas Podolski, Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla all joining since the end of last season, while Manchester United paid $26.6m for Dortmund's Shinji Kagawa. Mancini has been forced to watch on as City has failed to finalize deals for the likes of Arsenal's Robin van Persie, Roma's Daniele De Rossi, Liverpool's Daniel Agger and Swansea's Scott Sinclair. City are keen for Mancini to trim the club's wage bill with both Emmanuel Adebayor and Roque Santa Cruz surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium. But the Italian has finally managed to complete one piece of business with the acquisition of England midfielder Rodwell on a five-year deal. The 21-year-old, who could eventually cost City $26m, is in contention to make his debut against newly-promoted Southampton on Sunday. \"Man City are a massive club, the league champions, so it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's a dream come true,\" Rodwell told told the club's official website. \"It will be an amazing experience to make my debut in front of them if I am selected to play next weekend. \"Obviously I knew the squad is immense with talent here but I believe in my ability. I've just got to work my way into the manager's plans and hopefully things will go well. \"The hard work starts today as I start to help contribute to the club winning more silverware. The season has started really well with the Community Shield win.\" Rodwell graduated through the Everton youth system after joining the Merseyside club as a seven-year-old. He has already made two appearances for England and could win his third cap in Wednesday's international friendly match against World Cup finalists Italy in Berne - a repeat of the recent Euro 2012 quarterfinal. Rodwell is the second big-name player to leave Goodison Park for City in the last three years following the departure of Joleon Lescott in a $34.5million deal back in 2009. \"It's been kept under wraps quite nicely,\" said Rodwell of the transfer. \"It's been going on for the past couple of weeks but the last couple of days it's progressed really quickly. I'm just pleased it's done. \"I would like to place on record my thanks to everyone at Everton.

Anders Behring Breivik is on trial in the bombing in central Oslo that left eight people dead, followed by a shooting spree at a youth camp on nearby Utoya Island, where 69 people died. \"The police and security services could and should have done more to avert the crisis,\" said Alexandra Bech Gjor, head of the July 22 Commission looking into the attacks. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said after the report was published that he had \"ultimate responsibility for the preparedness in our country, a responsibility I take seriously.\" But he said he would not resign. According to authorities, Breivik set off a fertilizer bomb outside the prime minister's office on July 22, 2011, killing eight people. He then took a ferry to Utoya Island, the site of a Labour Party youth camp, where more than 700 young adults were meeting. Authorities say he roamed the island shooting at campers, killing 69 people before members of an elite Norwegian police unit took him into custody. Experts disagree about whether Breivik was sane at the time of the killings, a critical factor in what sentence he will face. He does not deny the killings but says they were necessary to protect Norway from multiculturalism. Police could have reacted faster during the attacks, saving lives, the new report found. \"A more rapid police operation was a realistic possibility. The perpetrator could have been stopped earlier on 22 July,\" the investigators concluded. Police operations centers were understaffed, and the availability of helicopters was \"limited,\" the report said. Police forces faced immediate criticism after the attack because they had to travel to Utoya Island by boat rather than helicopter. But the failures of \"leadership and communication\" were more significant than failures of resources, the commission found. Police information-sharing \"is subject to formidable weaknesses,\" and the Police Security Services had not done enough training for a terrorist attack, the commission said. The Oslo bombing itself \"could have been prevented through effective implementation of already adopted security measures,\" the report found. It also suggests that police could have been aware of Breivik before the attacks took place, but said there were \"no grounds for contending that the Police Security Service could and should have averted the attacks.\" The report criticizes Norway's gun controls as \"inadequate,\" even though \"Norway is a country with a large number of weapons.\" And it suggests a failure to understand that one person operating alone \"could cause so much devastation.\" Police are due to respond to the report later Monday. The investigators praised the health and rescue services for their response to the wounded and bereaved, and said government communication with the public was good despite the attack on its headquarters. Norway's government set up the commission after the attacks, the worst massacre in Norway since World War II. The commission had access to confidential reports, interviewed hundreds of people and got access \"to everything we asked for,\" its report says.

Key to the Czech Republic's 7-5 2-6 6-3 victory was her decisive break of serve in the final set to condemn her Chinese opponent to a third final loss of the year - following Li's reverses in Sydney and Rome. It was Kvitova's first appearance in a final this season and the win meant she won a Tour event for the first time since the season-ending championships in Istanbul last October. \"The first set was a really big fight - every game was very close,\" world No. 5 Kvitova told the WTA Tour's official website. \"Maybe I was a little bit lucky to win the first set. She played very well in the second set. She was very aggressive without any mistakes.\" Kvitova's triumph in Montreal was all the more impressive considering the 22-year-old suffers from asthma, which usually adversely affects her performances in North America due to the summer humidity. \"I have asthma so I have trouble breathing sometimes, but it wasn't too humid here this week,\" she explained after reaching her first final on the continent. \"It's only a problem in North America, unfortunately, because here it's more humid than Europe or Australia, where it's very hot but not that humid. Humidity is the main problem for me. \"But it's great to know I can play well here and it's great I finally won a title this year. I'm so glad it could be here at the Rogers Cup in Montreal.\" Desite the loss, Li showed glimpses of the form which made her China's first grand slam singles champion at Roland Garros last year. At the start of the second set Li, who has returned to the top 10 of the world rankings of the back of her performances in Canada, won 16 points in a row. \"I really have to say she played very well today. I think we both played a very good match,\" Li said of her opponent. \"I'm very happy because this was the first hard-court tournament after the Olympics, and my new coach is going to come to Cincinnati, so I think this is a very good start to this season for me.\" Li recently started working with Justine Henin's former coach Carlos Rodriguez.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-14 10:44:57", "modified_time": "2012-08-14 10:44:57"}

This last fortnight has made me feel like a foreigner in my own home as a collective wave of happy-clappy good will descended on this once curmudgeonly isle. Where has our natural suspicion of organized fun gone, our disdain for overt displays of emotion, our celebration of hapless failures. It's easier for my fellow cynics, most of whom probably fled these shores long before the official sponsors parked their corporate juggernauts on our lawns and the athletes arrived for the glorified sports day known as the Olympic Games. But I had to remain in London to help with CNN's coverage of the spectacle, and boy was it tough seemingly being in a minority of one. The singer Morrissey reliably poured his usual words of scorn on the parade, criticizing the \"blustering jingoism.\" He added: \"\" But while I secretly sympathized with him, I bet he didn't have to run the gauntlet of thousands of smiling flag-waving enthusiasts on London's public transport system every day of the Games. It was bad enough in 1997, following the death of Princess Diana, when a similar wave of hysteria overtook Britain. Then, complete strangers cried together and hugged each other in the street, as they mourned a pampered princess whom they had never met. Commentators opined on page after page that Britain had entered a new era in which adults were able to discuss the hitherto taboo issue of emotions in public. Many of us hoped they were wrong. But this time it's far, far worse. Not only are we all supposed to rejoice that PS9 billion of taxpayers' money has been spent tarting up part of east London that I have never visited and now have even less reason to go there, we must all celebrate and cry uncontrollably when sports men and women win events that I have never even heard of. Coxless fours? Taekwondo? Handball? I wouldn't have minded if there were real sports in the Olympics - crazy golf, kite-flying, staring contests to name just three of my favorites - but many of the events that really took place are just crazy. Before the Games, I was quite hopeful that something would go marvelously wrong in the British tradition. We'd got the dates wrong, and it's actually taking place next year. The swimming pool would spring a leak. The medals hadn't been made. But oh no, everything went to plan - IT DIDN'T EVEN RAIN - and suddenly we're a \"nation at ease with itself.\" But before you board your flight home and hail Britain's flawless organization skills, spare a thought for curmudgeons like me.

Rossi, who won the world title four times with Yamaha and three with Honda, has struggled to be competitive since joining Ducati, managing just two podium placings in 28 races. The 33-year-old has agreed a deal for the 2013 and 2014 seasons, resuming a partnership which Yamaha described as a \"super team\" when the news was announced last Friday. \"I think our relationship has got better, though maybe it's got better because we were in different teams,\" Lorenzo said on the MotoGP website ahead of this weekend's Indianapolis Grand Prix. \"It's good news for Yamaha because we achieved a lot of good results together. It's a big motivation to have him back because I always like to have the best riders in my garage. \"Valentino is one of them. I assume trying to beat me will be a big motivation for him. For Yamaha, it will be a good thing, that's the most important thing.\" Rossi won 46 races in his seven years at Yamaha, but his final season was blighted by injuries and Lorenzo took full advantage. The Spaniard lost his crown to Casey Stoner last year but tops this season's standings by 23 points from Honda's Dani Pedrosa with five wins and four second-placings from 10 of the 18 races so far. Rossi is eighth overall, but still ahead of Lorenzo's 10th-placed American teammate Ben Spies, who will leave Yamaha at the end of this season. \"Someone who has talent normally keeps it and doesn't lose it like this in two years,\" Lorenzo said of Rossi. \"He is still young enough. He is 33, he has won a lot of races. With the Yamaha a better bike this year, it will be easier for him. \"It's true that us younger riders are getting stronger, more experienced and more consistent, but we have to remember that Valentino has won a lot of races. We have to respect that and keep it in mind.\" The 25-year-old missed out on a podium place at Indianapolis last year when Spies passed him to take third, but won the U.S. race in 2009 and has twice been third himself. \"I really enjoy riding the Indy track, and have good memories here from my podiums in 2008 and 2010 and my great win in 2009,\" Lorenzo said. \"Last year I really struggled with grip in the race so I hope we can improve that this year. I've had a nice break but also been training to make sure I'm fit for this weekend!\" Honda's Stoner and Pedrosa have won the last two Indianapolis races, and both are seeking to cut Lorenzo's lead following MotoGP's midseason break. \"In these two weeks I was able to relax a little, enjoy time with friends and get back into my training,\" Pedrosa said. \"At this time of year, Indianapolis is normally very hot so fitness is always key. I enjoy riding at this track and I've had good results in the past. I am really looking forward to this race and will fight to win and maintain the consistency we have showed in the first part of the championship.\" Stoner is 32 points adrift of Lorenzo in third place despite winning four races this season, which will be his last as he plans to retire after the final race in Valencia at the relatively young age of 27. \"I'm not the biggest fan of Indy, mainly because we don't go on the historical track but the infield and in the wrong direction,\" said Australia's two-time world champion. \"The track is very flat and plain, also very tight. There are a couple of corners that can be fun but the majority are difficult, tight and there isn't any natural flow to the track.\"", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-14 12:58:52", "modified_time": "2012-08-14 13:22:27"}

The Serb, who lost his position at the top of the world rankings following Roger Federer's Wimbledon triumph, did not drop a set during the defense of the championship he won during his dominant 2011 season. The five-time major winner took advantage of all three break points he earned during the match to wrap up victory in just over an hour. Djokovic was pleased to have bounced back after a disappointing loss to Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro in the recent bronze medal match at the London 2012 Olympic Games. \"It's a big tournament, one of the biggest we have in tennis,\" Djokovic told the ATP Tour's official website after securing his 31st career title. \"I'm very happy to be in this position. \"I truly did not expect myself to win this tournament after the emotional losses in the Olympic Games. I really took it hard. I tried to bounce back and recover; I've done great, I have to say.\" Having also won the Rogers Cup title in 2007, Djokovic became only the third Open era player to win the event at least three times, following in the footsteps of Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi. \"I'm not one of the biggest servers in the game, that's for sure, but I always try to focus on the second shot after the serve,\" said the 25-year-old Serb, who has won seven of the eight matches he has played against Gasquet. \"I've been working on the efficiency of my first and second serve, but also trying to be aggressive in the first ball.

Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema, who both played for France at the Euro 2012 finals in June, were first questioned two years ago about their alleged involvement in a prostitution ring. \"Some of the defendants will be prosecuted for 'aggravated pimping,' although I cannot disclose which ones at this time,\" the investigating magistrate Andre Dando told CNN on Tuesday. \"The trial is months away and will be well into 2013, I expect.\" Ribery plays for German club Bayern Munich, while Benzema is at Real Madrid. An official from Madrid, which won the Spanish league title last season, said the club could not comment as it had no information about Dando's statement. Bayern has yet to respond to CNN's request for a statement.

In addition, three public buildings were badly damaged during several hours of disorder, CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported. Amiens Mayor Gilles Demailly told BFM that the damage amounted to millions of euros. People were shocked and upset by the violence, he said. Images from the north Amiens neighborhood showed burned-out cars and the charred wreckage of a kindergarten and a sports center. Clashes were reported in the same area Sunday night, BFM reported. The latest violence, involving about 100 young people, broke out late Monday evening and carried into early Tuesday. The police officers were injured with buckshot, fireworks and projectiles, BFM reported. Police responded with tear gas but made no arrests. Speaking at a news conference in Amiens, Valls said that the violence shown toward police was \"unacceptable\" and that law and order must be restored. More security forces would be deployed Tuesday night to ensure there was no repeat of the trouble, he said. Valls said those suffering most from the disorder were the residents of the neighborhood affected. The area had already been designated a \"high security zone\" because of drug trafficking and other problems, he said, meaning extra resources were to be used there. A local resident told BFM the community was angered Sunday when police carried out an \"aggressive\" traffic stop as a funeral was being held for a young man killed in a road accident last week. Sabrina Hadji, a sister of the victim, said police fired shots as people - including women, children and the elderly - were gathered for the ceremony. The community is tired of being treated without respect and \"like animals,\" she told BFM, and a silent march was organized as an expression of \"anger because we are never listened to.\" Valls acknowledged there is tension between police and the community after the incident and said an inquiry has been ordered into the police operation. However, nothing excused violence directed at police and the torching of public buildings, he said. Valls said he had not come to Amiens to point the finger at anyone, but the rule of law must be followed. After the initial unrest Sunday, the mayor appealed for \"calm, respect and dialogue\" in a statement on the official website for Amiens, a city of about 130,000 people. Demailly urged communication between police and residents, saying it is important they have confidence in each other. Earlier Tuesday, Valls traveled with President Francois Hollande to the Var area, in southeastern France, to pay tribute to two women police officers who were killed in the line of duty in June, BFM reported. Hollande addressed the trouble in Amiens, saying that public security is \"not just a priority, but an obligation\" for authorities. More must be done to prevent and punish violence, delinquency and criminality, he told reporters. Hollande, who was sworn in as president three months ago, said the next budget would include additional resources for policing, after years of cutbacks. France has been shaken by unrest in poorer urban areas on several occasions in recent years, notably in 2005, when the deaths of two young men of North African descent sparked weeks of rioting.

The world No. 4 continued her imperious recent run with a 6-3 6-4 win against Greek qualifier Eleni Daniilidou at the WTA Tour's Cincinnati Open for her 35th victory in 36 singles matches. Williams has won singles and doubles Olympic gold at London 2012 and the Bank of West Classic since being crowned Wimbledon champion for a fifth time last month. However, the second seed was left frustrated after making 44 unforced errors against Daniilidou on Tuesday as she began preparations for another tilt at her home U.S. Open later this month. \"That's shocking. It's unprofessional.

Now I realize I have to hang in there if I'm not having the best day.

The third seed let match point slip in a second-set tie-break and fell 4-0 behind in the decider before rallying to win six games in a row. \"It was an interesting third set considering the whole match was really quite close,\" said the Australian. \"There were no breaks in the second set, and then straight away I got myself in quite a hole quite quickly. \"I thought I could still regroup and close that gap just a little bit, and if you do that, you never know what can happen.

The former world No. 1 now faces a race against time to fit for the Flushing Meadows grand slam. \"I just had a little bit of a back issue the other day in practice,\" the 29-year-old told the ATP Tour's website. \"I was supposed to play yesterday and we had a late request to delay it. I felt fine early on, and then I had one lunge forehand and, we have all had it, your back kind of goes out or spasms a little bit.

Westwood missed the cut at Kiawah Island following a 45th-place finish at July's British Open, and has reacted by dismissing respected coach Peter Cowen and bag-man Michael Waite. The English golfer is looking to arrest a slide which has seen him slip to fourth in the rankings, with his form falling away since finishing third at the season's opening major, the Masters in April, and then winning the Scandinavian Masters in June. Cowen coaches a number of players on the tour, including former major champions Graeme McDowell and Louis Oosthuizen, who finished 11th and 21st respectively at the PGA, and Westwood appears to have grown unhappy at the amount of time he was able to spend with his coach. \"Lee is very structured about going to the gym, but not about practicing so when Graeme McDowell and Pete's other players are booking him, Lee is leaving it late and is having to work around them,\" Westwood's manager Chubby Chandler told the player's website. \"Pete was at Kiawah for two days with Graeme this week when Lee wanted to work with him, so it just wasn't working out. \"When you miss the cut after that, it gets even more frustrating, and that probably brought matters to a head,\" explained Chandler, who used to manage 2010 U.S. Open champion McDowell and counts that year's British Open winner Oosthuizen among his current stable. \"Lee admits he needed to shake things up because he'd lost his focus and his enthusiasm a bit, because he wasn't getting the rewards for his long game.\" \"Lee needs to try something different with his chipping and putting. Lee's the sort who needs someone standing over him, making him hit chip after chip and telling him what he's doing wrong. \"It's not like he's got the yips or anything - he just needs to improve his technique.\" With the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs starting next week', Westwood has moved quickly to put a new support team in place for the opening event - the Barclays. Zimbabwean Mike Kerr, who has worked with Alvaro Quiros and Ernie Els, will temporarily take over as caddy, while a new coach is already working with Westwood. \"I won't say who it is, but it will become public next week, because he'll be working with Lee for a few days at the Barclays tournament,\" said Chandler. \"All I'll say is that it's not one of the usual suspects - it's someone a bit different. It's an interesting choice.\" The Barclays organizers have confirmed that Tiger Woods and new world number one Rory McIlroy will be paired together for the first two rounds at Bethpage. American Jason Dufner, currently third in the standings and a two-time winner this year, could still overhaul Woods at the top with a tie for second or better this week's final regular-season tournament, the Wyndham Championship. Two-time FedEx Cup winner Woods has committed to the first three playoff tournaments. Along with an appearance at Bethpage, where he won the 2002 U.S. Open, Woods will play at the Deutsche Bank Championship in Boston and the BMW Championship at Carmel.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-14 18:46:08", "modified_time": "2012-08-15 09:42:14"}

Bolton chairman Phil Gartside was saddened by the news, but insisted Muamba must now focus on his life outside of soccer. \"To have Fabrice here and with us is truly amazing and we are all very thankful for that,\" he said. \"We are all hugely disappointed that Fabrice will be unable to return to his playing career but we have to be guided by the medical recommendations and the best interests of Fabrice. \"The most important thing is that Fabrice and his family have the rest of their lives ahead of them.\" Bolton manager Owen Coyle, , echoed Gartside's sentiments. \"We have spoken with Fab and he knows we will always support him in whatever he wants to do and that we will always be here for him,\" said Coyle, whose team begin life in the second division on Saturday after being relegated last season. \"He is obviously massively disappointed that he won't be able to carry on his career, but everyone has seen what a fighter and strong person he is in mind and body. \"We know that he will go on to achieve great things and within all this disappointment, the most important thing is that he is here, alive, today.\"", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-15 14:35:09", "modified_time": "2012-08-15 14:35:09"}

Allen will fund the recovery and research expedition, sparing the British government any cost. A previous expedition by , a deep sea shipwreck recovery company, . This week the recovery team will return to the wreck site with a two-fold mission: Retrieve the ship's bell and document the remains of the battle cruiser in the hopes of later determining what happened in the Hood's final moments. David Mearns, director of Blue Water Recoveries, said the ship's bell was \"lovingly looked after\" by the crew. Its recovery is seen by those who lost loved ones as a way to commemorate those who died. The HMS Hood was sunk during a battle in the North Atlantic with in 1941. The Hood remains the largest Royal Navy vessel to have gone down, and resulted in the largest loss of life suffered by any single warship in British history. The wreck of HMS Hood is designated under the Protection of the Military Remains Act, meaning the recovery team had to seek permission from the British Navy in order to retrieve the bell. The mission was agreed to by the British Government, and the say the bell - if recovered - will form a tangible and fitting memorial to the ship and the 1,415 men who died when she sunk in the North Atlantic. Mearns recalls the astonishment of the team when they located the ship's bell, on their first dive, in 2001. \"There was just a miscellaneous pile of twisted and torn metal... most of it was very angled steel but there was this curved shape,\" Mearns remembers. \"We pushed in on the camera and, lo and behold, there was the bell sitting basically unattached, not connected to the ship [and] all by itself on its side.\" The team, Mearns recalls, \"were just stunned by it.\" The 40,000 ton wreck is strewn over two and half kilometers of seabed, and uncovering the bell was a stroke of luck for the recovery team. \"It's a really iconic item and personal symbol of the ship, but we were there conducting this investigation on a 'don't touch' basis. It never occurred to us, even for a second, 'What if we recovered the bell? Should we attempt to?'\" Mearns tells CNN. By the time Mearns and his team had returned to land, news of the bell's discovery had broken. A public debate had erupted over the ethics of disturbing a wreck where so many lives had been lost. Mearns gained the support of the - whose members include veterans and relatives of those who died - before seeking financial support to return and recover the bell. The association's president, rear admiral Philip Wilcocks, said in statement on the mission: \"There is no headstone among the flowers for those who perish at sea.\" Wilcocks added, \"future generations will be able to gaze upon [the Hood's] bell and remember with gratitude and thanks the heroism, courage and personal sacrifice of Hood's ship's company who died in the service of their country.\" If recovered, the bell will go on display in 2014, at an exhibition at the in the southern English port of Portsmouth - where the Hood was based. Mearns says: \"It's been out there as a wish of the association to do this and I've just been looking for the right sponsor to do it in the right way and to get the permission to do it. Lo and behold, there was the bell sitting basically unattached... We were just stunned by it. David Mearns \"I'd been working with Vulcan, Paul Allen's company, and it just so happened we could combine the availability of Octopus in the region at the right time, because you can only really work in this area two months of the year.\" The Octopus, the world's 13th largest megayacht, is a \"fantastically capable vessel,\" Mearns says. Despite being classified as a yacht, the Octopus carries equipment including a deepwater diving ROV [remotely operated vehicle] and survey and navigation equipment. The Octopus, says Mearns, \"is very qualified\" for the job. The British Royal Navy has asked the team to place an ensign on the site of the wreck, Mearns added. The mission also hopes to shed light on the final moments of the battle cruiser, which broke in two during the attack. It was under sustained fire from the Bismarck, but its own ammunition also exploded. The cause of its sinking has never been clarified. \"I think we are going to make a real improvement in the imagery and information that we bring back from the wreck to allow naval architects to look at and come to some firm conclusions about the damage,\" Mearns added. \"This isn't just a trophy hunt to go get the bell.\"", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-15 09:44:10", "modified_time": "2012-08-15 19:40:03"}

The 91-year-old Duke of Edinburgh first suffered the problem in June. He has been admitted for \"investigation and treatment\" and is likely to remain in hospital for the next few days, the palace said. The Duke of Edinburgh was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, the palace said earlier. He was staying at the royal residence in Balmoral, Scotland, where the queen traditionally spends part of the summer, UK media reports said. Prince Philip has suffered a couple of health scares in the past year. Prior to the bladder infection, which Prince Philip contracted in early June, during events marking the queen's diamond jubilee, he spent four nights in a hospital over the Christmas holiday last year for treatment of a blocked coronary artery. However, he appeared in good form earlier this week as he fulfilled several engagements on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. The queen and the Duke of Edinburgh also gave a garden party at Balmoral Castle last week. Philip's next scheduled public appearance is alongside the queen as she opens the London 2012 Paralympic Games on August 29. He also appeared by her side at the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games at the end of July and accompanied her on a visit to the Olympic Park as the events got under way. It has been a particularly busy year for the queen and Duke Of Edinburgh because of the many events held to celebrate her . Addressing parliament in March, the queen paid tribute to her husband as \"a constant strength and guide\" throughout her long reign. The longest-serving consort in British history, Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in November 1947 in Westminster Abbey. Born the prince of Greece and Denmark on the Greek island of Corfu in 1921, Philip left Greece with his family when he was 18 months old after King Constantine was forced to abdicate the throne following a revolution. The family moved to Paris and then to England in 1928. Philip also went to school in Germany. Philip renounced his Greek title when he became a naturalized British subject in 1947.

Their small shop in south London had been targeted by a mob of looters during the in two decades. It happened a few days after they celebrated the 20th anniversary of opening their business - Gisella's, a fashion workshop with designs inspired by the owners' African roots. In just a few hours of riot madness, Gisella and Jan Asante lost 20 years' worth of work. A display of valuable dresses made for high-profile celebrities: gone. Unique accessories, some from remote parts of the world: gone. Handmade jewelry: gone. Wedding dresses ready to be picked up by brides-to-be: gone. The overall loss is hard to estimate - on top of all the things lost and damaged, business slowed down for months. \"We were boarded for three months, that's how long it took,\" Jan said. \"People thought we folded, it felt like we were in prison,\" Gisella added. They estimate a loss of PS30-40,000 ($55,000-65,000), but say it's hard to put a number on it. \"The things are worth so much more. We made them all, they are irreplaceable,\" Jan said. Lot of our regular customers made an effort to help. They didn't really need anything, and they would still come and buy something. Our customers are amazing. Gisella Asante Fast forward a year and the place looks like nothing had ever happened. The only visible reminder of last year's events is a couple of wooden boards leaning against the wall. They used to cover the smashed windows. Now they serve as a notice board, with pictures and supportive letters from customers that flooded the boutique after the riots. \"People sent messages, emails, they phoned to say they were sorry,\" Jan said. The reaction was overwhelming. \"A friend of mine had to come in for a week just to answer the phone and reply to messages. It was like bereavement.\" The revival of the boutique is down to the Asantes' loyal customers. \"Lots of our regular customers made an effort to help. They didn't really need anything, and they would still come and buy something. Our customers are amazing,\" Jan said. There was a point, they say, when they wanted to leave the shop closed and walk away. But the customers kept coming. \"Having the customers, the work, it kept us going, we were on autopilot,\" Jan said. \"It was exactly as the British say: 'Keep calm and carry on.'\" Thank-you notes from clients are displayed all around Gisella's. Many include wedding and honeymoon photos, as the boutique has long been a hotspot for brides who want something special. \"For the brides, weddings are about culture,\" Jan said. \"They want to express their heritage, even if they are very modern, and they always ask us how they can show where they come from and who they are.\" The traditional-meets-modern is the key to their success. Gisella, originally from Tanzania, came to London from Kenya, where her daughter Jan was born to a Ghanaian father. It may sound complicated, but the multicultural heritage of the two women is exactly what makes their clothes special. \"We are inspired by modern Africa,\" Jan said. \"We consider ourselves African, but are also Londoners, and that shows in our designs.\" \"We are inspired by modern Africa. We consider ourselves African, but are also Londoners, and that shows in our designs. Jan Asante Their dresses are a mixture of modern cuts, African-inspired prints and precious fabrics from all around the world. Picking up a beautifully shaped dress, Jan points out the fabric. It comes from a remote area in Nigeria, where it was handmade. Together with a Western-style cut, it makes for a special piece of couture. \"I always talk to our customers about the story behind fabrics,\" she said. \"It's nice to walk around knowing where your clothes came from.\" The mother-daughter pair work as a team. Jan talks to the customers and prepares the designs, while Gisella is the one cutting the fabric and sewing. The workshop is strictly divided in two zones. Each woman has her own territory, where she rules. They say it works perfectly, even though they both admit there are clashes from time to time. \"She is my mum, you always have to do what your mum tells you to,\" Jan admitted. \"But we are also business partners. We have to negotiate and agree on everything. Sometimes it stretches your relationship to the limits.\" On the one-year anniversary of the looting the boutique was unusually quiet, and there was time for reflection. \"I couldn't ask for a better daughter,\" Gisella said, doubting she would have been able to cope without her during the long months of recovery. Then suddenly, she turned to Jan and said: \"You have more strength than I thought you have. I've seen you rise so much. I am proud of you - I never had the time to tell you.\"", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-15 12:27:39", "modified_time": "2012-08-15 14:46:45"}

The next day, the prosecutor's office announces it is rescinding the arrest warrant while the rape charge is unfounded. The molestation allegation remains. Assange is questioned by Stockholm police and formally told of the charges against him, all of which he denies as a smear campaign. Swedish prosecutors announce the next day that they are reopening the rape case against him, while the molestation charge will be upgraded to sexual coercion and sexual molestation. Swedish prosecutors announce the courts have approved their request to issue arrest warrants to question Assange, who is now in London. On November 20, the Stockholm Criminal Court issues an international arrest warrant for Assange, stating he is suspected of several counts of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force. Interpol later issues a \"red notice\" upon Sweden's request. Assange turns himself in to London police. He is remanded in custody after an extradition hearing finds him a flight risk. On December 16, the court finalizes its decision to grant him conditional bail. Celebrity supporters rally around him, paying his PS240,000 ($376,000) bail and providing a mansion for his house arrest. Assange attends extradition hearings at London's Belmarsh Magistrate's Court, which ultimately rules in support of his extradition to Sweden. Assange then launches an appeal at the High Court. After a series of hearings in July, the British High Court defers its decision until November, ultimately ruling against Assange's appeal. Assange has two weeks to seek the court's permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The High Court announces that Assange will be allowed to appeal its decision on the legal technicality of whether the Swedish public prosecutor is a judicial authority, a status needed to sign an arrest warrant. The case now moves to the Supreme Court, Britain's highest judicial authority. The Supreme Court denies Assange's appeal against his extradition to Sweden, but in an unusual move, grants him permission to file an appeal.

London police say he is subject to arrest for breaking the terms of his bail by seeking asylum.

After a brief hearing, they were ordered not to contact one another, to notify police before international travel and to appear in court again on September 26. They spoke in court only to confirm their names and addresses, and did not enter pleas. Five former News of the World journalists and the private investigator at the center of the scandal appeared with Coulson. Suspected hacking victims include some of the world's biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jude Law, Paul McCartney and soccer star Wayne Rooney, as well as victims of crime and terrorism, politicians and other celebrities. Coulson became a top aide to Cameron after leaving the newspaper in 2007 in the wake of the first phone hacking arrests, bringing the scandal to the heart of the British political establishment. Coulson resigned as director of communications for Cameron last year when police launched a second investigation into illegal eavesdropping for Murdoch papers in Britain. Coulson has always denied knowing about phone hacking, saying he resigned only because he bore overall responsibility for everything that happened at his paper when he was editor. Murdoch shut down the News of the World, the best-selling newspaper in Britain, over the phone hacking scandal. Appearing in court with Coulson were Neville Thurlbeck, Ian Edmondson, Stuart Kuttner, Greg Miskiw and James Weatherup, all of whom used to work for the tabloid, and Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator accused of actually hacking phones on their behalf. Dozens of people have been arrested over phone hacking and related scandals, including Rebekah Brooks, the former head of Murdoch's News International and a personal friend of Prime Minister Cameron. She was formally charged this month, posted bail, and is scheduled to appear in court on September 3. The men who appeared in court Thursday were ordered not to contact Brooks. Brooks, Coulson, Kuttner, Miskiw, Thurlbeck and Mulcaire are accused of intercepting messages of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old British schoolgirl who was abducted and murdered in 2002. Revelations that her phone had been hacked while she was missing and before she was found dead enraged the British public and prompted the closing of the tabloid. The long-running police investigation prompted by illegal eavesdropping at the defunct Murdoch tabloid The News of the World has expanded into probes of computer hacking, bribery and corruption. Brooks served as that newspaper's editor before taking the same role at The Sun and eventually rising to the CEO position with News International. The phone-hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism, led to the major tabloid's closing and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Murdoch. Prosecutors allege there were more than 600 victims of phone hacking between 2000 and 2006. The investigation and public notoriety have been damaging to News Corp. and to Murdoch, who stepped down from a string of company boards of directors in July and further distanced himself from the print business that first brought him fame and fortune.

The U.S. had drawn one and lost 23 of 24 previous matches in Mexico, but Michael Orozco Fiscal's late goal in Wednesday's friendly international was enough for a landmark success over the newly-crowned Olympic champions. Orozco Fiscal, who plays for Mexican club San Luis, netted from close range in the 80th minute to inflict just the ninth defeat for Mexico in 120 games at the Azteca Stadium.

None of the players involved played in Wednesday's Mexico City game. \"I think it's important for us to understand that we can compete with big teams at their stadiums,\" said Klinsmann, whose team recorded a historic first win in Italy earlier this year and next face two World Cup qualifiers against Jamaica in September. \"It's like when you play Wembley in England or Stade de France or in Berlin. Those are special occasions. I want the players to appreciate that.

Before the bladder infection, which he initially contracted during events marking the queen's , he spent four nights in a hospital over the Christmas holiday last year for treatment of a blocked coronary artery.

Tony Nicklinson's condition means it is impossible for him to take his own life - and he wants the legal right to have a doctor take his life without fear of prosecution. Since he suffered the stroke in 2005, the former rugby player, now 58, has had to endure what is known as locked-in syndrome. \"This means that most of my body is paralyzed but my mind is as it was before the stroke. All I can move is my head, and the stroke took away my power of speech. Now I talk to people with a perspex spelling board or a computer operated by my eye blinks,\" he told CNN in an interview in June. But while expressing sympathy for his situation, the High Court ruled Thursday that such a significant change to the law - involving overturning the ban on voluntary euthanasia - would have to be decided by lawmakers. The judges also rejected a similar challenge to the law brought by a second man suffering locked-in syndrome, named only as Martin. \"The Court recognised that the cases raise profoundly difficult ethical, social and legal issues, but it judged that any change to the law must be a matter for Parliament to decide,\" a statement from the court said. The ruling upset Nicklinson, who cried as his wife, Jane, told the waiting media that the family was \"bitterly disappointed\" and would file an appeal. In the meantime, her husband will have to continue living as he is, or starve himself to death, she said. In a statement given via his computer, Tony Nicklinson said: \"It's not the result I was hoping for but it isn't entirely unexpected. Judges, like politicians, are happiest when they can avoid confronting the real issues and this judgement is not an exception to the rule. \"I believe the legal team acting on my behalf is prepared to go all the way with this but unfortunately for me it means yet another period of physical discomfort, misery and mental anguish while we find out who controls my life - me or the state.\" His daughters, tweeting on his behalf Thursday, urged people to sign a petition via his Twitter account supporting his \"right to die with dignity.\" Within hours, more than 2,200 people had added their name. Jane Nicklinson said the family did not intend to go to Switzerland, which has an assisted suicide law, because it was expensive and her husband did not think he should have to go overseas to die. She and their two daughters fully support his battle in the British courts, which has already lasted several years. Speaking to CNN in June, Jane Nicklinson described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the \"life and soul of the party,\" making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear. \"He was a big bloke, ex-rugby player, he worked hard but he played hard. He was full of life, great sense of humor, loved the sound of his own voice,\" she said. And she said she wanted the judges to understand \"the injustice of it all,\" as they considered his case. \"You or I could go out and take our lives at any time we want, whereas Tony, being the one who really needs that right, can't do this - and he's only asking for what everyone else has got really, his right to take his own life, he wants that given back to him,\" she said. Before his stroke at age 51, the couple lived a comfortable life in the United Arab Emirates and traveled extensively. Tony Nicklinson was a senior manager with a Greek civil engineering contractor, a job he enjoyed, and was chairman of the local sports club. Although he does not necessarily want to end his life straight away, he is frustrated by the indignity and tedium of his current condition, which hasn't changed for seven years and which doctors say could continue for years. \"Some people have in the past spoken to me in the loud, slow and deliberate tones normally reserved for the deaf or daft. I am neither,\" he said. \"All too often, well-meaning able-bodied people just assume that if a person is so severely disabled that he needs assistance to commit suicide, he must automatically be unable to deal with such choice. \"I say that where a person has the mental ability, he should have the choice of his own life or death. The only difference between you and me is my inability to take my own life.\" Nicklinson has embraced Twitter as a way to communicate his views to the world and has more than 40,000 followers. He describes himself, with wry humor, as a \"Twitter novice with locked-in syndrome dribbling his way to an uncertain future.\" But asked if social networking service had made a difference to his quality of life, he said he views it \"as a means to an end, not an end in itself. Life is too painful for too many reasons for Twitter to make a significant difference.\" Nicklinson does not believe it unfair to ask doctors to end life, one of the arguments against a change in the law, saying it is not uncommon for doctors to make such decisions already in the course of their career. \"Doctors pledge to save life and to relieve suffering wherever possible. If it's necessary to end a patient's life to relieve someone's suffering, tough. Doctors can't pick and choose which bits they will do and which bits they won't - they signed up for the whole package,\" he said. \"There is too much emphasis on saving life at all costs and not enough thought given by society to the quality of the life saved. I am not advocating that doctors make the life or death decision at the time but the patient should be given the option of assisted dying, if he requires help.\" Lawyer Saimo Chahal, who is acting for Nicklinson, said ahead of Thursday's ruling that it would involve a \"very significant change in the law\" since there is no legal precedent in the United Kingdom. She said that Nicklinson would be devastated if the ruling went against him, but that he is a \"fighter\" who would want to carry on the legal battle against what he sees as discrimination on the grounds of disability. The Ministry of Justice had opposed a change in the law.

Its patented \"breathable shoe\" technology - a combination of a membrane insole that absorbs sweat and lets it out through an outer sole filled with holes - has turned the company into a multi-million dollar shoe empire. The idea of a sole filled with holes came to the company's founder, Mario Moretti Polegato, when he was on a business trip to Reno, Nevada, to promote his family's wine products. After the meeting Polegato decided to go for a wander in the hot Nevada Desert, and . As his feat quickly began to overheat Polegato decided to make holes in the bottom of his shoes. \"With my pocket knife I cut holes in the right and left part of the soles and I realized the ventilation in my shoes,\" he said. When Polegato returned to Italy he started to develop a shoe with holes in the sole that let air in and perspiration out. The design was patented and in 1995 Geox was founded with five employees; today it employs 30,000 people around the world. Scientific and technological innovation has been key to Geox's success, and the company has patented numerous new materials in rubber, leather and fabric. Each prototype is designed in Italy but to shorten delivery times the company outsources much of its manufacturing to Asia. \"We invest a lot in quality control. In every factory where we produce there is an Italian technician, a shoemaker, that controls shoe by shoe,\" said Polegato. Despite being Italy's number one shoe brand, the economic crisis has affected sales in Geox's core market. The company's distribution network is clogged up with last year's stock and orders for next season are down. Polegato says the solution is to look further afield than Italy and its neighboring countries: \"Our strategy now is to invest more in some countries with economic growth, like the Asia Pacific area, Eastern Europe, India and Turkey,\" he said. Nearly seven years after Geox opened a megastore on Madison Avenue in New York City, the company is looking east to expand its empire. \"Our program now is to open 300 Geox stores in China,\" he added.", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-16 16:12:47", "modified_time": "2012-08-22 15:56:41"}

There is obviously the whole debate going on if he is going come back for this year. I hope he will. He's definitely got some more weeks off now because of it.

The decision is a victory for Assange, who is trying to avoid being extradited to Sweden and has been holed up inside Ecuador's embassy in London for nearly two months. But the bad news for Assange is that British police have refused to grant him safe passage out of the country. The British government has pledged to send Assange to Sweden to face questioning on sex crimes charges, but Ecuador's foreign minister says if Assange is sent to Sweden, he could then be extradited to the United States to face charges of espionage or treason. Assange and his supporters say a U.S. grand jury is weighing charges against him. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said that the Justice Department has an \"active, ongoing criminal investigation\" into the WikiLeaks disclosure of classified U.S. diplomatic documents. CNN spoke to Paul Whiteway, an ex-British diplomat of more than 30 years and now director of the Independent Diplomat advisory group in London, about where the Assange situation is heading. Can Assange leave London? The fact Ecuador has granted political asylum to Assange doesn't actually make any real difference. Clearly he is not in Ecuador, he is in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and for the time being he is able to remain there without being arrested. But he can't get to Ecuador without leaving the embassy without being arrested, so in a sense, it's a standoff. Could Assange escape by car or by plane? It's very unlikely. The embassy only occupies a part of the building, and is not a compound embassy, which has a car park inside it. Vehicles belonging to the embassy enjoy a degree of immunity, so if it was a compound embassy, he could get into the car, which could in theory take him out of the building. But at some point it would have to stop, and he would have to get out of the car and into an airplane, whereupon he would be arrested. But Ecuador's is not a compound embassy, so as soon as he steps out the door he is liable to be arrested. Immunity would in theory apply to an Ecuadorian airplane, but that plane would have to have permission to land that the British government would not give. It's really hard to see how that could work. Also, that sort of subterfuge would be regarded as such a blatant disregarding of the convention on diplomatic relations that the bilateral relationship between Britain and Ecuador would mean even further damage to Ecuador's interests in the UK. Is there anything British police can do? All they can do is wait and watch. In theory the foreign secretary could make use of a 1987 act of Parliament to end to the inviolability of the Ecuadorian embassy, but this would take authorities into a gray area. Theoretically, this legislation is to be invoked in cases connected to public safety, national security, or town and country planning. Clearly Assange fits into none of those categories, and it's unlikely the British police will be going into the embassy anytime soon. Is there a precedent for marching into another country's embassy? While authorities could theoretically test the 1987 law, I can't think of any instance in this country where a government entered the premises of a mission (embassy) without permission from the head of the mission. The reasons for that are clear: Britain doesn't want to have itself in a situation where foreign governments can just march into its embassies overseas and arrest people. Diplomatic relations are established on the basis of reciprocity, and that is very important. How have Britain and Ecuador handled the Assange issue? In Britain, I suspect that in the Foreign Office there may be a slight sense of regret that they included a paragraph in their letter (to Ecuador) about the 1987 law (informing officials they had the legal wherewithal to enter the embassy and take Assange), because clearly it stung the Ecuadorians in a way. But I think it was always going to be a long haul to get this issue resolved, given that President Rafael Correa is quite sympathetic to what Julian Assange stands for; given that he had already been on the record publicly saying he was in favour of granting Assange asylum. It was always going to be difficult for him to walk away from that without losing face. Can Assange stay in the embassy forever? I don't think Mr. Assange is going to be going anywhere, let alone Ecuador, for the time being. There was the case in Hungary of the for 15 years, so some cases can take literally years to resolve. What will the atmosphere be like in the embassy? I'm sure they will have made him as comfortable as possible in the circumstances as they possible can. But it's a big distraction from their day job, and it's awkward having someone who's not on the diplomatic staff actually inside your embassy for any length of time, let alone for periods of months, so there is a price to pay from the embassy's point of view.

In fact, she said in the absence of a real story they will simply \"generate\" one just to get their picture on the cover. None of that is new, but what has changed is the amount of \"celebrities\" this practice now extends to. It seems every company wants to affiliate itself with a celebrity and, whether they like it or not, footballers are some of the biggest global celebrities around. With the advent of social media everybody can now maximize their fame well beyond the 15 minutes Warhol predicted. It is now extremely difficult, if not impossible, to police the sometimes slanderous ramblings of others and, as a result, the newspapers suddenly found what they offered the public was rather tame in comparison. It could be argued this mini war led us down the path to the Leveson Inquiry (set up to investigate phone hacking of British celebrities by News International) far quicker than we would have got there without it. During that battle there were many casualties, as we saw from the amount of people that had their phones hacked by News International. These included friends of mine that, having spoken with them and a number of footballers since, have all but condemned the media and some of its practices when before they would have been fairly nonplussed. The scandal has harmed the trust between \"sports stars\" and the media in this country and the media has only itself to blame. Everybody knew that parts of the media were less than trustworthy but I don't think many of us realized exactly how deceitful and disgusting some of them were prepared to be. Some time ago I was turned on to a column in The Financial Times called \"The Secret Agent,\" who worked in London sourcing real estate for the very wealthy. I became hooked on the idea of the column as much as anything else. His writing is excellent but I could never shake the thought of how huge a secret footballer column could be. I kept in contact with many of the journalists that have wandered in and out of my career. It was only because I was involved in something with one in particular that I ran the idea past him. I had planned to go to another paper but the journalist I needed to speak to was on holiday. My friend set up a meeting with The Guardian's deputy editor. He was sold on the concept there and then, and he has backed the idea brilliantly ever since. It has been a great experience so far and I am thankful they have embraced it so warmly. But it honestly hasn't affected my relationship with the media in any way. I'd be lying if I said I had more respect for those in this industry now I've experienced a small part of it. Quite honestly, I never see much of it at all. I can't walk into The Guardian's offices and I can't speak to anybody else about it, so all I do is write a column and submit it. If you know the basics of how to compile a column of 1,000 words and you know your subject intimately, it is all quite straightforward. I'm sure once I'm uncovered my life is going to be hell for a time, hopefully it will only last for 15 minutes. It can be a lot of fun when people bring it up in conversation. On those occasions I let them ramble on before saying, \"He's an idiot, mate, you don't want to take any notice of him.\" It can be scary. I have never had a great poker face on account of the fact I don't play poker. I am sure many of them suspect I am \"The Secret Footballer,\" but it would still surprise them if he was in their own changing room because it is the sort of thing that always happens at another club. I went into this knowing I could annoy a lot of people and I was willing to take the flak when the curtain came down. If you like it, great. If not, it really isn't any bother to me. If The Guardian come to me and say they have had enough, it will not be a problem. It certainly won't stop me pitching new ideas to them. I'm not sure if it is entirely dishonest. I think what the media would see as taking a liberty is perhaps what another person would call entrapment and/or slander. There are some really interesting stories out there about players' career paths and their backgrounds. It is a pity the red tops (tabloid newspapers) can't embrace just a tiny part of that rather than focusing in on the controversy around football. On the part of the journalists themselves, in any industry there are some very capable professional people who do a good job. There are also some people who go about the same business by stitching their subjects up. For too long the media got away with far too much. I still find it odd a newspaper can plaster quotes about somebody all over a newspaper without attributing them to anyone. I would like to see an experiment where quotes from \"sources,\" \"friends,\" \"an insider\" etc were banned unless the person was named. Journalism would change overnight and it would be interesting to see exactly how. I don't see it as a problem, I am not sure how much harm it really does. If it is persistent then perhaps it might become a little tiring having to sit in press conferences and deny it every week. Most of us players, or our agents anyway, will use the media to plant a story for the sole purpose of extracting an offer from a rival club. If you see a player linked to a club then the chances are the player is on the move - but not to that club. It is the oldest trick in the book. Amazingly it can still panic a manager into putting an offer in on a player who he thinks he might lose out on. If Manchester United were quoted on the London Stock Exchange then, in theory, its biggest rivals could easily plant stories in the media about its star players not being happy and looking to leave the club, thus affecting the share price and creating disharmony. It has brought a lot of the vicious comments which are shouted from the stands directly into the homes of the players. But it has also reconnected many fans with their heroes. It must be amazing for a kid to have the chance to ask his hero anything at all, especially when he gets a reply. Personally, I'm all for it and I enjoyed it very much in the beginning. This is the brave new world and Twitter is a growing part of how people have decided they want to communicate with each other, we would all be naive not to be a part of it. Don't write it off yet as I have a book coming out. I'm constantly coming up with new ideas and it is our intention to evolve as we go, the secret brand is merely the starting point for building our platform. It is a trusted brand because contributors are endorsed by major organizations and it is our aim to grow the website so the \"secret\" aspect is just a tiny part of what we offer. It is a great platform to build on because it's new to the market and has a natural curiosity which draws people in. Our traffic has continued to grow even after the season finished so it is an extremely encouraging start. Finding the funding was a challenge though, I had to pitch the concept to potential investors without giving anything away. Most of the meetings consisted of me saying things like, \"Look, how long have we known each other?\" In the end it was funded by emotional blackmail!", "tags": [""], "published_time": "2012-08-16 16:22:33", "modified_time": "2012-08-16 17:09:31"}
